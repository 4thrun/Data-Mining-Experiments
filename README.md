# Data-Mining-Experiments

A collection of data mining experiments done during the data\-mining course\.

## 1\. Douban\-Spider👻

A tiny spider that fetches a list of [Douban Movie Top250](https://movie.douban.com/top250)\. **No** further analysis however\.

## 2\. Iris\-Classification🎉

Iris can be divided into three different varieties according to its calyx and petal size\. This experiment is to show how to analyze data and build a classification model as a novice (me)\.

## 3\. Order\-From\-Tmall🛍

This experiment makes good use of `pyecharts` to make data visualization, using 3 datasets about Tmall (Double Eleven, wholesale)\. While cleaning data and building visualization, valuable information can be revealed from the datasets\. 

Finally, an **RFM** model is implemented to predict the most valuable customers\.

> RFM means:
>
> - R-Recency, last purchase time 
> - F-Frequency, consumption frequency
> - M-Monetary, consumption amount
