   
   
      
         All right, this is Elissa Adams and Elissa, you've lived in Charlotte for--
      
      
         Five years.
      
      
         Five years.
         OK.
         Um.
         First thing I want to ask is if you remember any books that you read as a child um, or either books that were read to you either by a teacher or your parents or grandparents that you really remember enjoying.
         Is there anything in particular that comes to mind?
      
      
         No.
      
      
         Nothing.
         OK.
         Um.
         How about stories, that uh, you didn't read or weren't read to you, but stories, you know how people come up with stories, I mean, is there any, were there any particular stories that people told you that you really liked hearing when you were growing up?
      
      
         
         Not that I can remember, no, uh uh.
      
      
         OK.
         Um.
         How about when you were in school?
         Everybody has to read stuff in school.
         Do you remember anything that, um, I mean, there are always books that I liked, I always had to read everything but uh, there were certain things that I liked more than others, do remember anything you liked in particular, um, about stuff you had to read maybe in your English class or um, things like that?
      
      
         Nothing.
         Nothing I re, that I recall.
         No.
         Not really.
      
      
         No?
      
      
         Not really.
      
      
         OK.
         Um.
         Well, what about now, like um, Thanksgiving's coming up, and families get together for that and for Christmas when, when you are um, you know eating dinner, or you know, just talking and everything.
         Are there particular stories either, either family stories that you might tell or stories about, um, you know things that have happened to people in the past?
         Or maybe stories that, you know, some people just make up stories to tell.
         Are there any particular stories that your family tells now?
      
      
         Oh.
         Lot of times we just sit around and just reminisce and go back to the time when we were growing up.
         
         Family, um.
         
         Um.
         Anything in particular?
      
      
         Well, do you remember one of those particular stories that um, might come up when you're just sitting around reminiscing?
      
      
         Well, a lot of times we had company over.
         Um, I guess the time when I was four.
      
      
         Hum?
      
      
         Uh, my mom took me for a it, um, doctor's visit uh, it was a physical.
         The doctor got, did some tests and uh, done some tests.
         He dia, diagnosed me as having acute leukemia and um, this was when I lived back in Raleigh.
         And uh, Momma and I took trips back and forth to Chapel Hill and went through a couple of treatments and uh, you know, uh, ( ) uh, I had, had to have different shots each time I went back.
      
      
         Uh-huh.
      
      
         It was, and the little I remember, Momma telling me on the way, you know, just little things I don't know really, let me think now.
         Um.
         
         I guess I was in a wing of the hospital where five or six other children in that whole wing of the hospital, well, in that, that wing and everybody went through the same treatments.
      
      
         Uh-huh.
      
      
         And uh.
         
         Uh, let's see.
         Turned out after all the treatments were done, I was the only survivor in the particular wing of the hospital.
         Well, you know, to this day every now and then that particular story comes up every now and then.
      
      
         So, when, when that comes up, does, is your mom primarily the one who would tell it or your dad?
      
      
         Both.
      
      
         Either?
      
      
         Actually, my sister wrote a story on it.
      
      
         Oh really?
      
      
         And I have it back in my room.
         It's just one of those things that you know, you just don't think people want to hear much about these days.
         It's just one of those things, you know that happened.
         And it was one afternoon I was out playing on the uh, sidewalk and uh Mom was, Mom was in the kitchen doing something and I was, I guess pretending to act like a salesman and I went up to the front door and rang the doorbell.
         And Mom came to the door and uh, she saw like this glow of light all around me as if the Lord had definitely cured me of leukemia.
         No more treatments, no more.
         
         What do you call it?
         Um.
         
         Nothing more.
         Actually, I went back to see my doctor and when I, everything you know was fine.
         Nothing, you know, nothing more to do.
         He knew right then that it was a miracle, miracle child.
      
      
         Would you say that um, your mom or you dad or whoever is telling the story, tells that part of the story, the, the last part when you came to the door and she saw the glow of light, would you say that they tell that part of the story more than any other part or do they tell the whole thing from beginning to end?
      
      
         Beginning to end.
      
      
         OK.
         What, you said that you were four?
      
      
         Four.
      
      
         And I'm sure you remember parts of it.
         Um, do you remember everything that your mom, like when she's telling the story, do you remember everything she tells or is some of it you remember and some of it you don't?
      
      
         I pretty much remember the whole thing.
      
      
         The whole thing?
      
      
         I was old enough at the time that I knew what was going on.
      
      
         Yeah.
      
      
         And uh, I remember exactly going to the hospital and the uh, waiting room, but um, yeah, it's just something you don't know anybody goes through.
         It was a very interesting experience.
      
      
         Do you ever tell this story yourself?
         Obviously you're telling it to me.
      
      
         I have told it to several other people, like my co-workers and to this day they can't believe it, they would have never known.
      
      
         Uh-huh.
      
      
         Well, you, people don't know unless I share it with them.
      
      
         Right.
      
      
         The Lord helped me for a reason.
         I was on this earth you know, I've lived on this earth for some reason, I just don't know what it is yet.
         
      
      
         Um-huh.
         
         Well, as far as being a story, this is not an ordinary story that every family tells, obviously some do, um, is it something that comes up a lot or is it you know, something that your family doesn't talk about a lot or is it something that comes up on a pretty regular basis?
      
      
         Maybe once in a while.
      
      
         Once in a while.
         OK, well um, are there any particular stories related to this or anything else you enjoy reading now or um, I mean, is there anything looking at what you experienced, is there anything, any type of stories that you like to read now or that you like to hear about now?
         Maybe other people who survived leukemia or other diseases that you know were life threatening like that or I mean, do you ever try to find out other people's experiences?
      
      
         I do enjoy reading the um, stories related to Guideposts or uh, what's another, Reader's Digest, they come in.
         
         ( ) When cancer comes up I'm just pretty, pretty interested in it, to find out what they went through and I can relate to it.
         Other than that, I get more out of reading Reader's Digest or Guide, Guideposts stories.
      
      
         Um, OK.
         Well thank you very much and thank you for sharing your story with me.
      
      
         Oh, you're welcome.
      
   

   
   
      
         Woman's voice TAPE 1 SIDE A @ 5:20 minutes
      
      
         Can you please share your name?
      
      
         Stephanie Adams.
      
      
         And where are you from?
      
      
         South Charlotte.
      
      
         OK, and your age?
      
      
         18.
      
      
         OK.
         And so what year does that make you, are you a--?
      
      
         I'm just finishing up my freshman year in college.
      
      
         And did you find that to be kind of hard, or did, you know--?
      
      
         Wha, yeah, very hard compared to high school.
      
      
         It was?
         Um, now why did you decide to stay in Charlotte to go to school?
      
      
         Um, I wanted to be closer to my family, number one, and, um, number two, I have a lot of friends coming here, which helped me a lot, and, um, I just liked the Charlotte, um, UNC Charlotte because I wanted to be a, a nurse.
      
      
         Do you still want to be a nurse or--?
      
      
         Not anymore, no.
         
      
      
         How come, just--
      
      
         It's just not me.
         I've, I've decided and it's very hard.
         The, um, curriculum here is very hard.
      
      
         Right.
         That's what I've heard, it's extremely hard.
         What have you decided, what are you going to do?
      
      
         I'm going to do Education now.
      
      
         Do you plan on staying in Charlotte?
      
      
         Um, yes.
      
      
         So you do feel like you like Charlotte as an area?
      
      
         \\Uh-huh, yes.
         \\
      
      
         \\And you'll stay here?
         \\
      
      
         Yes, definitely.
      
      
         For any particular reason or you just like the area?
      
      
         Um, I like this area a whole lot and it's, it's growing so much and I just want to be near my family so I can take care of them whenever they get older.
      
      
         What do your parents do?
      
      
         They're actually both teachers.
      
      
         So are they happy that you're going to be a teacher?
         Or do would they rather you have stay in Nursing?
      
      
         They would rather me stay in Nursing because they know that's where my heart is but, um, you know, they're behind me in whatever I decide to do.
      
      
         Do you feel like you did well this sem, this year, or if you had to do it over what would you do differently?
      
      
         I wish I could take back my whole freshman year.
         I've done horrible, let's just say horrible
         really, really bad.
         In high school I was, you know, 3.0's, you knows A's and B's an occasional C. Now here I'm lucky if I get a C on something.
      
      
         Right.
      
      
         C's and D's, you know, and that's just not me.
         I wish if I could do it all over again I would stay home and study instead of going out with my friends, which has really hurt me a lot.
      
      
         Do you think that's what it was?
         Was it the freedom aspect of it or?
      
      
         Definitely the freedom, definitely the freedom.
      
      
         Uh-huh.
      
      
         Even though I had freedom when I was, you know, home, whatever, but I still had a curfew.
         But here in college you don't have, I mean you can do what you want to, come and go as you please.
         Uh, you don't have to answer to anybody except yourself.
         And I've learned, um, at the end of this year how to manage my time, which I hasn't helped me out very much.
      
      
         It hasn't?
      
      
         No it hasn't because my grades are still pretty bad.
      
      
         
         So do you plan on working on it next year?
      
      
         Oh definitely.
         I have to set some goals for myself next year.
         If I don't then I probably won't come back to this school anymore, which I don't want that because I love this school I love the friends that I've made here everything about this, this place I love.
      
      
         Are your parents putting a lot of pressure on you?
      
      
         Definitely.
         Definitely, I'm feeling the pressure from my dad.
         He's, they're like, they're not disappointed but they just know that I could do a whole lot better.
         And it, it kind of makes me feel bad.
         I feel like I'm letting them down, so to, so to speak.
      
      
         Kind of letting them down.
      
      
         Yeah.
      
      
         So you're just going to work a lot harder?
      
      
         Work a lot harder, um, take some classes that I think are going to interest me more.
         That's one thing about this school is they just give you like certain classes to take and they don't let you pick and choose what you want to take and stuff.
         And, um, I just wish that my counselor would have been more helpful to me.
      
      
         So you felt like you didn't even have anybody there to guide you?
      
      
         I have nobody here to guide me.
         I was pretty much, you know, on my own and I'm not used to that because in high school--
      
      
         Right.
      
      
         --the teachers were much more, I guess, I don't know�
      
      
         Lenient SA: --lenient, you know.
      
      
         They would guide you and kind of show you what you need to do and stuff?
      
      
         Yeah.
         They were more like my friend and I wasn't like a number in their classroom.
      
      
         Uh-huh.
         Do you feel like that's just in Charlotte that that's how the school systems are?
         Or do you feel like in general that's how high school is as opposed to college?
      
      
         I feel like it's that way everywhere.
      
      
         Uh-huh.
      
      
         Yeah.
      
      
         Is there anything else you want to--?
         Oh no!
         Don't get nervous!
         Is there anything else you want to talk about or is that pretty much all you had to say?
      
      
         That's pretty much it.
         I'm just going to tell everybody that they need to study!
         Definitely study!
      
      
         And work hard.
      
      
         Work hard study balance your time, you know.
         You can go out on the weekends but during the week it, you know, it should be study time.
      
      
         Well thank you for sharing your experience with me.
      
      
         You're welcome.
      
      
         And it was nice talking to you.
      
      
         Nice talking to you.
      
   

   
   
      
         OK.
         Um, we're going to talk about today childhood stories and what I'm wondering is what are the stories you remember as children?
      
      
         I recall, a number of stories.
         My mother read a great deal, to me.
         Ah, Uncle Wiggly was a favorite.
      
      
         Uncle Wiggly?
         What was that about?
      
      
         That's about a rabbit, and about a farmer that used to chase the rabbit out of his, uh, carrot patch and, uh, all the characters that were associated with that.
      
      
         Was that your favorite story?
      
      
         I think that's one I remember, a lot because when I was in 1st grade, I was sick a lot of the year, and I was out of school a lot of the year.
         And, uh, because of that, my mother read to me a lot, you know, to help me, me feel better
         .
         So, she uh, she read a lot of Uncle Wiggly stories to me.
         But I think the story that was, was a favorite was one that my mother made up herself, utilizing characters from, you know, like Bugs Bunny and, and Thumper and Bambi and all that.
         And ah, she, she made it up, a story about a, me and my cousin Phil, ah, going on this trip to the Canadian Northwest to hunt and meeting these little characters, uh, while we were there.
         Of course it can't be published because all those things are copyrighted, but my mother made up the story and I thought it was very nice and I still have it, uh, handwritten, uh, in our file here.
      
      
         OK, how about you Mom?
      
      
         I remember, uhem, Peter Cottontail and the farmer chasing him under the wire and Peter Cottontail getting out just in time.
         and I remember Mickey Mouse stories.
         I liked those Disney World things.
         Of course, who knew about Disney World a hundred years ago but, um, Mickey Mouse was a favorite.
         And, um, Little Women, that was and, now I had three older sisters, and I always kind of envisioned us patterned after Little Women, and, because
         there were four girls in that family and I loved that story; read it over and over again.
         I fact, I took you to Louisa May Alcott's home in Massachusetts, and we, ah, umm--.
         Let's see, other stories.
         Oh I hated, I, well, I'll just tell you that later.
         Um, uh, I, I, I just, um, I guess I'm drawing a blank here.
         I can't think anymore.
      
      
         Well, what was your favorite story?
         If you had to pick out of all of them?
      
      
         My favorite story, um, oh, Cinderella.
         I just loved Cinderella
         .
         I also saw my sisters as the wicked stepsisters sometimes
         , and I was Cinderella, running around waiting on them.
         
      
      
         What, ah, story in your childhood had the most impact on you?
         I'll ask you first Mom, and then Dad.
      
      
         Oh...um, most impact on me?
         
         I think, Oh Heidi!
         I loved Heidi, and that, in fact, I wanted to name one of my children Heidi
         because I loved Heidi of the Alps.
         Um, as far as having an impact on me, I guess, uh, being a good girl and doing all the right things.
         Those were the stories I read, OK Dad, want to tell--
      
      
         What's your favorite?
      
      
         
         Well, I'll tell you there was a record, Roy Rogers and Gabby Hayes, and I still quote it today when I'm, when I'm being funny.
         And it had to do with the description of all the cowboy paraphernalia that was, ah, existent at the time.
         Like tapaderos that were on the, the, uh, place to protect your boots in the saddle [Laughs and reverts to `normal voice'] and all that sort of thing.
         So I remember silly things like that, that were a lot of fun
         .
         I read, uh, the story that, I don't, this isn't, ah, I think the first real story that I read was, uh, The Red Badge of Courage.
         Uh, more serious, and that was, that was a very interesting story because it was the first time I came upon a character who was real, who was afraid, who ran away who, uh, then came back and, uh, and conquered his fear which is something that we all have to do from time to time.
      
      
         What are your least favorite stories?
         When you're thinking of stories that affected you and really you abhorred.
         What are those stories?
      
      
         Well, Aladdin and the Lamp!
         That genie that came out of that lamp scared me half to death!
      
      
         Was that told to you or did you read that?
      
      
         Um, that was told to me and I saw that genie coming out of the bottle in the picture in the book was not about a kind and loving genie.
         It was kind of scary looking and I thought, "Ooh!
         I don't think I'd like to meet up with that genie!"
      
      
         Well, who told you that story?
      
      
         Ooh, one of my three older sisters.
         Probably Lois, your Aunt Lois.
      
      
         I can't think of a story that, uh, had a real negative impact on me.
         Umm, I guess I'll leave it at that.
      
      
         Um, when you're talking about your favorite stories, what was your favorite part of the story?
      
      
         Remember I told you about the story my mother wrote and I can remember at the time and in some ways it's still true today.
         Ah, the favorite part of the story was the fact that I had somehow bought an old Model T Ford.
         
      
      
         How appropriate!
      
      
         
         That was the favorite part of the story!
      
      
         Well, I think all the happy endings we read as children Pollyanna, you know and, uh, everything always seemed to turn out right.
      
      
         \\So, these were your favorite parts?
         \\
      
      
         \\Stories I liked, yeah.
         \\
      
      
         What were your least favorite parts of the story?
         What parts of the story were boring?
      
      
         Oh!
         In Little Women when Meg died, Oh dear!
         That was so traumatic and, ah, Swiss Family Robinson.
         Uh, I loved the part where they would, you know, make things out of nothing.
         They made a home out of, out of things they found on the island, fashioned things, oh uh, implements, uh, out of coconut shells and whatever stones and whatever they could find.
         I liked that part.
      
      
         Did you identify with any of these characters?
         And what's the one you identified with the most?
      
      
         Well, I think I identified with Jo.
         She was kind of headstrong and she was, um, kind of artistic maybe, and, uh, uh, liked to have a good sense of humor.
      
      
         Yeah, the main, I, The Red Badge of Courage, the main character, at first I had never, you know, all of the cowboy stories that I saw or read, it was, uh, uh, you know, the good the bad and the good were very good and the bad were very bad.
         And this was the first occasion where the good person had some, some flaws.
         So I didn't like that at first, and then, of course, you know, as the story unfolded, you would, uh, relate that to your own experiences of being afraid and, and learning to conquer those fears and that kind of thing.
         So I thought it was, uh, uh, it was at first a part of the story I didn't like, but afterward, uh, you know, it certainly taught a lesson.
      
      
         We're talking a lot about childhood stories and stories that um, were read to you and what were the first what did you start reading when you were first allowed to choose what you read?
         What did you choose?
      
      
         Well, I chose to read the ones that had been read to me.
         We had a great big book of Grimm's Fairytales, and looking back on that they were grim!
         They were scary, throwing a child in the oven and all that sort of thing!
         However, it didn't seem to be so horrifying.
         It was a story and I, you know, you knew it was fiction, but I would go back and read, when I could read myself, I read everything.
         I read the backs of cereal boxes.
         I read everything I could get my hands on.
      
      
         I didn't do a lot of reading.
         I guess I read a lot of classic comics.
      
      
         Classic comics, yeah!
      
      
         Uh, well yeah and I remember Ivanhoe and, uh, The Disinherited Knight and all that kind of thing.
         I was always into those kinds of heroic things, um, so I read a lot of those things.
      
      
         I forgot about comic books!
         Oh, Archie and, oh I loved Archie comics.
      
      
         Oh yeah, superheroes like Captain Marvel, Superman, Batman and all of them.
      
      
         I'm talking to you as your you know my Mom and Dad and, uh, what were, if you know, what were your Mom and Dad's favorite stories?
      
      
         My father read, uh, liked history and read, um, a lot of historical, uh, factual things, not into fiction at all.
         Uh, my mother was probably so busy running around taking care of all of us,
         I guess she read, um, I think she read biographical things rather than um, novels.
      
      
         My father didn't read anything in terms of what you'd call a book, uh, but he was analytical of the Sport of Kings, and, so would peruse the paper to check on that
         .
         But, uh, my mother, uh, you know, didn't read a whole lot, but spent a lot of time reading to me, uh, my being an only child.
         Uh, so yeah, I took up a lot of her life and she read a lot of children's stories to me as a result of that, but I don't believe she read a lot for her own amusement.
      
      
         At that time, and now later on she, she lives at the library just about.
      
      
         Absolutely does.
      
      
         So, it's like she, uh, and the education wasn't the same back in those days.
         So um, you know, it was different people would read for different reasons and I think your mother has, um, you know, she's educated herself at the library.
      
      
         Yeah, that's true.
      
      
         We're talking a lot about stories and, um, novels and children's books, was there any poetry that was your favorite?
      
      
         Golly, I never really got into poetry.
         Yeah I had to take it, as children?
         Or high school?
         I just really didn't ever love poetry for some reason.
      
      
         I still recall, and I'm sure your mother does too "Whose woods these are, I think I know His house is in the village though;" and I won't go beyond that but, uh, you recall that Gail, when we were, when I was in college and we were first dating that was a, a favorite poem of, uh, us and our friends.
      
      
         Was that self-written?
      
      
         Oh no.
         That was Robert Frost.
      
      
         OK, I thought so.
         Um, and we're talking about childhood and middle school, what about high school?
         What about high school into college into adulthood what are some of the books that you read?
      
      
         Oh, gee.
         Um,
         Can we turn that off while I think?
         One in particular I read while in college that we just howled over and that was Catcher in the Rye, by J.D. Salinger.
         Um, Peyton Place was, had, um, kind of a fascination because I was at summer camp in NH, near Gilmanton Iron Works, where that woman, the author, lived.
         So, that was such a racy and shocking book at that time, and so, of course, we had to read it.
         I. I liked, uh, oh gosh, go ahead Dave you've got--
      
      
         Well, I remember another book that you read that that I didn't read but that, uh, painting was made `84?
      
      
         Oh Ayn Rand?
         Yeah, um--
      
      
         And I remember that being, appearing to be so far in the future.
      
      
         Atlas Shrugged.
         Oh yes, and George Orwell books I read, uh, uh, um 1984 and what's the other one?
         Animal Farm and they, yeah, it was so far in the future, and, my gosh, now it's the past.
         Whew!
      
      
         Into adulthood, what books do you like now?
      
      
         I like, uh, political non-fiction, and I've read The Making of the President series from 1960 on up.
         I, I like, uh, uh, those kinds of things that talk about why people do what they do when they're in positions of political power or aspiring to positions of political power.
         I also like to read things about the Civil War.
      
      
         I've read all the, the lawyer books, Grisham and Turow and a lot of the, um, current, uh, writers, novelists.
         Um, oh gosh, Anita Shrever is one, um, Rosamunde Pilcher, Maeve Binchy, um, I like all of that type of reading.
      
      
         Have you ever read any books from foreign authors?
         Somebody who obviously that English was not their first language, but they wrote a book?
      
      
         Um, I'm sure I have I just can't think of what.
         Um, I just can't think of what one.
         You know what?
         I should have remembered back as a freshmen, I read An American Tragedy.
         And, and years later we ended up living in the place where that took place and the, uh, and it was not something that was, uh, not a subject that people liked to talk about because many of the people in town knew the young man who was charged with that murder.
         And so that was really interesting, uh, in retrospect.
      
      
         I can't remember reading anything, foreign authors.
         As I say, American political non-fiction doesn't exactly lend itself to that.
      
      
         Dostoevsky.
         I mean I'm sure I have read I just can't even remember what, Dr. Zhivago, I read that.
      
      
         Did you notice any differences between an American writer and someone of foreign descent?
      
      
         Oh well, the cultural differences would come through in the writing, yeah, sure.
         Um, I wish I could think more.
         I just can't remember.
         Go ahead.
      
      
         Well, I'm going to ask a final question that, um, I mean, you're my parents, and you imparted a lot of, uh, a lot of the love of reading to me.
         Uh, how important it was to read and we're all English majors, I think that has something to do with it; my brother, sister and I are all, we're all English majors in college.
         So, what I am going to ask you is what was your philosophy behind that?
         Why is reading so important?
      
      
         I can't imagine not reading.
         Reading is the basis of all learning.
         I can't imagine not reading and for pure enjoyment and, uh, for growth, broadening your knowledge base.
         Um, reading is fundamental as they say and it truly is.
         What a sad thing if people can't read!
         If I had, if I was retired, I would definitely be working in aliteracy, um, you know, volunteer literacy capacity.
         I think it's so important.
         It's such a handicap not to read.
      
      
         I think, uh, that intellectual stimulation is very important I think thinking is very important I think reading is a part of that.
         And I, uh, too often, much too often, see people, um, feeling superior somehow because they don't read, they don't think, they don't experience other ideas.
         And so, uh, those things come about through the work of reading rather than through listening to some person on the street corner or, uh, gazing on TV.
      
      
         Well, thank you for being part of this study
      
      
         Our pleasure!
      
      
         Thank you!
      
   

   
   
      
         How should I start?
         
      
      
         However you like.
      
      
         Well, life there in the country is, nice, tranquil.
         I lived working all of my life with livestock.
         I always had to get up early, milk the cows, and, uh, run, run them, as we say, because it's a, to the pastures, until times got pretty bad, and one day, I sent my daughter to, to the pasture to bring in the cows.
         We brought them back in the afternoon, when I saw that, behind her there came a big group of, they looked like soldiers, but in street clothes.
         Then, she cam, my daughter came almost green, pale, and she said to me, "Mama," she said to me, "Those are guerrillas!"
         That was the first time I saw them, the gue, the guerillas.
         Then they went on, they didn't make it to the house.
         At about, about three weeks later, then arrived a group of about four, at my brother's house, and told him, that they were coming to, to be, that is to take control of the place, where we lived.
         Well, but that they weren't going to steal, they weren't going to kill, neither would they harm the people, but it we didn't, if we worked with them.
         But if we didn't want to work with them, we shouldn't get them into anything with the mil, military, such as, informing on them, or something like that.
         So, time went on.
         Then when, well, since I lived alone, only with my son, they, would seek me out because, I always had, everything, because I had all kinds of animals, including doves from Castile, uh, turkeys, ducks, hens, pigs, cows, all kinds of animals.
         So they would, they would always come to me, and they told me, "Ma'am, sell us milk, sell us yogurt, sell us cheese, or sell us a, a hog, a plump hog, well I had to sell them, and I am going to sell," he'd said, "if you sell them to everyone else, sell to us, too."
         I say to him, "OK."
         And that's how, I kept on, working and, with them.
         They there, well, they'd come from time to time to buy things, until one day, well, they already had been there for several years, when, all of a sudden along came a young fellow who went around with them whose name was Jose, they call him "Chepon" because he was tall, white, and all.
         So, he, he came looking for, yogurt, I don't know what he came looking for, for me to sell him.
         And when I was giving it to him, he said to me, "There's going to be, a meeting now."
         "When?"
         I said to him.
         "No, tomorrow at four," he said to me.
         "Where?"
         I said to him.
         "In Piedras de Sal," that was, like a, pretty, level, place where, they gathered.
         And I said to him, "I'm not going to be able to go."
         "Why?"
         he said to me.
         I said to him, "I have a lot to do," I said to him.
         He said to me, "You have to go," he said to me.
         I said to him, "don't you know, Chepe, what it is?"
         I said to him, "that they want to do in that meeting?"
         He said to me, "we can't say."
         I said to him, "But you know, I'm your friend, tell me why."
         Then he said to me that, "they're going to set up a board," he said to me, "where they're going to appoint," he said to me, "a president, vice president, secretary, treasurers," and all that.
         And I said to him, "And what is that for?"
         "Because they're going to set up a committee," he said to me, "so that when those big battalions," he said to me, "of guerrillas arrive, these people attend, for example, the president is going to talk to the rest so that they all get food together for them.
         And they've picked you," he said to me.
         "Me?"
         I said to him, "Why?"
         I said to him.
         He says, "Yes, because you have less children, and can have more, time, or more, ability to get around to the people so they, will help out."
         "And I said to him, "Yes?
         President of what?"
         "They call it," he said, "The Committee of Forsaken Mothers."
         I said, "Really?"
         "Yes," he said.
         So, I said, "No," I said, "I'm not going to be able to go."
         He said, "But, don't you ever tell, that I told you, because-," he said.
         He motioned to me as if they were going to cut off his head.
         I said, "No, I'm not going to tell them."
         So, the next day, I left early in the morning for San Miguel, to see my daughter, and when I was coming back, I went by my brother's, which was a place in, a town called Chapeltique, and I arrived at his place, and I said, his name is Salomon, and I said, "Brother, I am here to see if you'll give me posada (lodging)," we call it, like you give someone a place to live in your own house.
         And he said, "What's going on?"
         I said, "Nothing, it's just that, I don't want to be there any longer," I said, "Look, it's just that I have lots of problems with the animals, I don't even have a pasture."
         He says, "Really?"
         I said, "And do you think you can help me?"
         I told him, "I'm coming."
         "Yes," I says.
         That same while that I was there at my brother's, we went to look for, the people who owned land, to see if they would give me, pasture land for the animals.
         And, yes, they gave me some, and I left.
         It was getting, I got there late, like at, six in the afternoon, I got home, and after I waited for it to get dark, I went to my neighbor's.
         My neighbor had about four, five grown boys.
         So I said to him, his name is Pedro, I said, "Pedro, I came to bother you."
         "Uh, huh?"
         I said, "If you, if you would lend me your boys tomorrow."
         "What for?"
         he said.
         I said, "I need," I said, "I need for you to lend me them to me, tell me, and I'll pay you."
         He said, "Yes, you know," he said, "You can count on them, and me, too, if, if you need me."
         I said, "Look, I need them to, over there, about five, six in the morning, five- thirty, because I'm leaving here," I said, "and I want them to take the most important things to town for me," because, since from, from my place to town was about two hours, on the road, walking, then, because no cars came through.
         So he said, "OK, that's fine."
         And, the same way I went out to another, er, e, cousin, his name is Cristobal, and I said, "Cristobal, do you have to, what are you doing tomorrow?"
         "Nothing," he said, "Why?"
         "I was going to bother you," I said (), "so you come with me," I say, "I want you to do me a favor."
         "Uh-huh?"
         "I want to leave," I said, "but I don't want anybody to know.
         If you help me," I said, "to move my livestock to Chapeltique."
         He said, "But, to take the livestock, I can't, I can't do it alone, at least, four," he said, "because, it's difficult with the animals."
         "OK," I said, "So, how do we do it?
         You suggest something."
         "OK," he said, "Let me, wait for me here, I'm going to let dad know, and Cristobal's neighbors' friends."
         And he left, and that's how it was.
         When he came back, he said, "Yes," so, he said, "I'm going to leave here," he said, "from your house for Chapeltique at four in the morning with the livestock."
         And that's how it was, he left, at dawn, and he said, "See you there," and he left with the, with the livestock, with the, and the, the others who were going to help.
         I stayed at home, finishing straightening up, and the neighbors, Pedro's boys, already took my things to town, and, we left for Chapeltique.
         We arrived, at my brother's, and Cristobal, with the livestock and the rest, still hadn't arrived.
         They arrived at night, but they brought them for me.
         And that's the way it as, how I kept working there.
         After I worked there, then, that, I went to, San Miguel, because my daughter, also, had, she needed me.
         And, I kept on, and finally when I saw that life was really expensive, and I didn't have, I couldn't work anymore since I'm not a professional, then I decided to come (to the US), because also, well, the, there in that area, since now there wasn't anywhere to work, I had left hidden from the guerrillas, and, well, that's what I continued.
         Well, and I forgot to tell you when the soldiers came, to my house, the guerrillas were there, the guerrillas went back.
         They hid and, the soldiers came to the house.
         It was, when the first one arrived, the first soldier, and he said, "Er, ma'am, make," he said, "some four, six rations," he said, "because plenty of soldiers have come, and I'm going to inform the other houses."
         I stayed, making the rations of food when a group of soldiers arrives, and when I was, fixing the food, in the kitchen, because of the sun, because of the reflection of the sun, I saw, a weapon pointing at me, so that was when I said to him, "What happened?"
         And he said, "Don't play," the soldier said, "don't play," he said, "innocent," he said, in that house, I, our house is huge, and I stayed locked up, because just me and my son lived, my baby son, tiny, and me, and well, that's all.
         And I said, "I don't have anybody," I said, "hidden away."
         He says, "Don't let it happen to you like the people in Ateltisate," that was another area, "where we did away with the place, because, they covered up the guerrillas."
         I told him, "I don't cover up anybody," I said.
         Then, with me at gunpoint, two behind, followed me so I opened the door, and there was nothing in the house, thank God, because there was no one there.
         Then, since then, I, I was, like, when I saw military, I felt like I, I, that is, a great fear, a terror of, the guerrillas, I was afraid of them, but the military, was worse.
         And I couldn't, well, do anything else.
         We lived between, between the border of Honduras and El Salvador.
         Then, they, the guerrillas passed through this river, that divided (the countries), and it filled up (with men), when you remembered it, it was full like any base!
         And then the soldiers would pass through just the same.
         So you couldn't tell what kind, at night, what kind of people were going by, but you could hear clatter, because even beasts full of weapons, with, everything, you know?
         So that time, that I told you about when the, the soldiers came, my son escaped, dying, from fear, when I go that they had me at gunpoint, and they surrounded the house, but it passed, they didn't do anything.
         The next time the soldiers, came through, the guerrillas were in front of the house, in the road, there's one, of those huge rocks, that you can sit on, and when they were eating.
         When all of a sudden, a girl went by, I was washing (clothes), a girl went by, and she told me she was going to here mom's, her name is Victoria.
         And when, the guerrillas, ah, well, the girl went by and very shortly she came back.
         And I said, "Why did you come back, Victoria?"
         "A huge group of soldiers are coming!"
         she said, "I mean, a huge group!"
         she said, "so I'm going."
         So, I came in, from where I was washing, I went in, and I didn't see what the guerrillas did with themselves, because I didn't see, they were in front, but since I went it, I didn't see.
         Then, you know, that in order to keep yourself out of trouble, you go in and don't, then they come, or, that was another time, that I suffered a terrible threat when the soldiers come through.
         And he said, "Ma'am," he said, "what did the guerrillas that were there eating do with themselves?"
         I said, "Sir, I've gone in, and I don't know, the house is big, and I went inside," I told him, "I haven't seen anyone."
         He says, "Look, ma'am," he says, "you deserve to have your tongue cut out, because you are covering for the guerrillas."
         I told him, "I don't cover for the guerrillas, or for you .
         Why would I cover for them?"
         So he says, "No, from the school up, are all guerrillas."
         I said, "The fact, you, I, you can be there," I said, "or I can stay here and you go in," I said, "you don't see where I get off to."
         Then they left, they left for the mountain, they went on up.
         Then a huge throng of soldiers came, and they shot over the house, that, we have to, my dad always used to have a lot of, we call them cercos , of, of pure ijiote of, of, made of poles that are nice and fresh.
         Then every little bit, since they were shooting those bazookas, and who knows what kind of, of things, and all the tops of the trees were falling, they fell, and since the roof was made of teja (tile).
         Do you know what a teja is?
      
      
         I don't know.
      
      
         But, it's like this
         , in plenty of shapes, I see that here, they also have some shaped like tejas too.
      
      
         Are they, like, rounded?
      
      
         No, they're long things like this
         , they come down to here, and here another one goes on top, yes, very pretty, like, like between, orange, because they're fired, they're made of fired clay.
         Well, then, the dust from the, the tiles, was falling, because, well, they were destroying them, right?
         Well, so many bullets, so many things.
         Then, and the neighbors, and a niece of mine and a cousin lived there, and bullets went through my nephew's, and he had a five-year-old daughter, who was the only one who was there, because her mom, had gone to bring water, and she stayed, because of the firefight, she also stayed inside, so that she wouldn't, the little girl locked herself in, and thank God, she survived.
         And when, then that was the first time that my little boy came down with, as if, I don't know, he didn't faint, but he, he turned purple here [indicates area around her mouth], green and then purple, and then he stopped breathing, fell to the floor.
         So, then, I grabbed him, and when I grabbed him, I put him under the bed, and I went outside.
         In, uh, in the window in front, we have a window facing the street, there was a guerrilla lying on the ground, firing at the soldiers.
         On this other side where the bedroom was, I went outside, and I saw him, well, the size of the flame, when the flame from the rif, from, the bullet came out, even with a small flame like this
         .
         I told him, "Please, sir, get away from here, don't you see the danger?"
         I said.
         He sa, he didn't answer me.
         Red-faced, tired, and red-faced, the man, and on the other side, the other end of the house, there were two others, shooting, so that, also, also stretched out on the ground.
         Then I said, "Dear Lord," I said, "what are we going to do about this?"
         Well, they went through, they broke a soldier's leg, you could hear his moaning.
         Then they went through, since they were carrying him away like that.
         And that's the way it stayed, the firefights there, in that place, and the firefights.
         Well, one day, I sai, I was going from San Miguel, uh, to Carolina, my brother lived, my brother was the principal of that, of that school there, in Carolina.
         He worked, he's a teacher, and at that time he worked as the principal of that school, of that school, because it was a, like a high school, there was, from first (grade) to high school.
         So, early that morning, that afternoon, I came down from San Miguel, and I told him, "I'm going to go."
         He says, "Don't go.
         They're making trincheras," they call them trincheras, where they're putting mounds of stones near the houses, so that the bullets there.
         He says, "And it's going to be very dangerous and it's very late."
         So, I said to him, "Oh, well, I'm going to go when it's morning."
         My son was already two, not even two years old, like, like about, like a year and a half.
         So she, he, my brother and his wife had two boys too.
         One of the wife's brothers had come.
         When, all of a sudden, at daybreak, my, my brother went to, to bring a, to the well close by there, two jugs of water, his wife and he, and I stayed in the house, making coffee.
         That, the sun hadn't come up yet, it was still like, five in the morning.
         Well, it wasn't light yet when the gunfire starts.
         Because in the front of the two the re's a mountain that they call El Volcancillo (the little volcano) below.
         It's just that, what a firefight!
         They were shooting, shells, bomb, even from those bazookas, and I don't know what kind of weapons.
         Well, my brother had a, cow, tied out, and a goat, the cow's offspring.
         Well, he milked the cow every morning, but that day, he couldn't milk her, because the gunfire was so heavy, and because everything was falling near the house.
         So, my brother said, "I'm going to cut her rope, I'm not going to be able to untie her," he said, "Because it's really difficult with, by the time I untie her, they'll kill me," he says.
         "I'm going to cut it with the, a knife, the knot, so the cow can go and she won't die."
         Then, he, is, when, a shell like this
         falls that went into the ground, but, a lot.
         And the, the fragments, as they call them, cut him here [indicates several parts of body], cut him here, cut his here, cut him here, and I don't know where else, but there were many, but the deepest one was this one
         .
         He didn't say anything.
         We were down, I had my son under me, on the floor, Ines had one, and Ines brother, that is, the boy's uncle, had the other boy under him.
         Only Luis Alonso had gone out.
         Well, nobody noticed my brother until he said, "Vieja (Old lady)," he said, because that's how they talked to each other, "Vieja," he said, "I may be going to die," and we turned him around to see what the, the.
         He had a pillow, one of those big pillows, and it looked red, all of it with blood and swollen like this
         .
         So he said, from the running down from several places, but the one that, this one [indicates eyebrow], was, was too much.
         So she said, Ines went out, and opened the door and said, "Bastards!"
         she said to them, to the guerrillas, "Bastards!"
         she said to them, "because of you we're going to die too, through no fault of our own!"
         she said.
         They didn't answer.
         She closed the door, and Ines said to me, "What are we going to do with Luis Alonso?"
         Now we, now we didn't, we didn't pay attention to the kids, we had forgotten about the kids, we were going to attend to my brother.
         But, a car was coming by with a white flag that meant "peace" and in that car there was a friend of Luis Alonso's and also a guerrilla came in that car.
         And, so they came in through the interior door there, they turned like this, and came in through the door, and, and they knocked.
         "Luis Alonso, Luis Alonso," says to him, Luis Alonso's friend.
         Than Ines says to him, "What was it?"
         she said.
         "Open the door, please.
         I've come to see Luis Alonso," he says.
         Because, well, no, Ines was putting up an argument that-, when he told her, "No," he said, e, Luis Alonso, "I may be going to die," he said, "because so much blood loss," he said.
         "No," he said, "I'm going to take you to such guerrillas' doctor," and they took him away.
         They took out all the rest (of the shrapnel), but the one in his eyebrow, they couldn't get it out.
         So, they tool him away, we didn't see him anymore, they took him to San Miguel, I don't know, if in that vehicle, surely in the same car they were riding in, they took him to the hospital.
         Then, we were left, and since they were still in front of the house, we went to a woman's home, who was a nurse, so when a big round of gunfire started, we covered ourselves up against the walls of the houses, we walked a little way, we threw ourselves against the other wall, until we could get there.
         And when we got there, the woman said, "Go on in to the main house," and another house father inside.
         And there was a wounded, a wounded woman by, by a bullet too, that they had brought, since she was a nurse, and there we were.
         The woman prepared food, but she only gave it to the children.
         All that day, we didn't get up (off the floor).
         So, we stayed there.
         And then, well, we found out that my brother had been admitted, until they took out th, that (fragment0, they let him come, but now he didn't come, he went to, to the department of education and asked a transfer, they didn't deny it to him, they transferred him to another place immediately.
         Then he came and we stayed on in the same place.
         Then, now, well, like I told you, there were plenty of times that, that we had encounters like that.
         There in, in another part of Tejutla, they also killed a brother-in-law of mine, my sister's husband, because the guerrillas also came in in the night.
         They had a big firefight like that, and there was my bro, er, my brother-in-law was, he also died.
         That's the way, way it was, they're big, plenty, if I were to tell you all the stories of what we went through, I tell you, that I'd keep you all night
         .
         That's how it was, it was said, but thank God in the family hardly-- The guerrillas also took out a man from the outskirts near the, the place where we lived, who was called Juan.
         He was like a catequist, one of those people who helps the priests, and according to the guerrillas, they say that he was starting to get them in trouble with the army, I mean, he started to say where they were, so that the soldiers would go directly to where they were, and one day they (guerrillas) took him out and killed him.
         And they put out the, the word that yes, they had killed him.
         So, and if another, another person did that, they were going to kill him too.
         Because, there were a lot more things.
         And what else do you want me to tell you?
         
      
      
         If you want to keep on, that's fine, but, so much time!
      
   

   
   
      
         Don't be nervous.
         OK.
         What's your name?
      
      
         Shannon Averitt.
      
      
         And, how old are you?
      
      
         19.
      
      
         And where are you from?
      
      
         Charlotte, NC.
      
      
         Where in Charlotte?
      
      
         West side of Charlotte.
      
      
         OK.
         And how was growing up in Charlotte?
         Did you like it or?
      
      
         Yeah, I liked it a lot.
         When, um, I was little, I lived more, near Lake Norman side of Charlotte.
         If you're not from Charlotte, you're not going to know where that's at, but, um, it was really far away from everybody and behind the airport and stuff like that.
         And, um, my junior year of high sch, high school, we moved into like the city, the west side of Charlotte, and I went to West Meck, and that was a, um, culture experience, \\ I guess \\.
      
      
         \\ How \\, how come?
      
      
         Because it was more diverse.
         Like in most schools in Charlotte, if you go on other sides, it's like everybody's just white, but in my school, there was every kind of person you could ever meet.
         So, I haven't met one person at UNC-Charlotte that I didn't meet in my high school.
         I can compare them to, like black, white, Asian, whatever, grunge, redneck, it doesn't matter.
         
      
      
         Do you think that's a good thing that it helped culture you, or--
      
      
         Yeah, it did because I know people from Charlotte now that went to like, not to slam Providence because I like a lot of those people, but they like have like so many like stereotypes of people because they don't know anybody.
         But then like, I know people like that and they're people just like anybody else is.
      
      
         OK.
         And so is there anything in particular about growing up that you want to share that maybe changed you as a person?
         Or made you the person that you are?
         Anything in particular?
      
      
         Hmm.
      
      
         Tough question.
      
      
         Yeah.
         OK.
         My dad, um, `cause I wasn't really like I was a girl, I mean I was a girl.
         I mean, like my junior year of high school the first dress I ever owned was my junior year prom dress!
         
            . Like because my dad always treated me like a boy because I was like I was the first girl on my dad's side of the family in like, four generations or something like that.
         Like my great-grandfather's brothers and da-da-da-da and then my dad had one brother and my two older cousins were both guys.
         And then there was never like any female blood Averetts until like my oldest cousin had kids.
         But like, so I was always raised like a tomboy and everything like that and my dad treated me like a guy all the time.
         And that's like I can totally see my dad in my personality.
         Like when I lived at home, we did not get along at all for anything in the world; we would fight all the time.
         I moved out and we get along perfect.
         `Cause we're like, now I can say this because I'm older or whatever and I can like deal with it, I'm exactly like my dad.
      
      
         
            
         
      
      
         But, when I was younger, I would have shot myself before I would have admitted that me and my dad were the exact same!
      
      
         So you guys get along really well now?
      
      
         Yeah.
         Unless I'm like, when I go home for like Christmas break, after being there for like two weeks, it was like I'd never moved out and we get kind of like tense with each other.
         Basically because we both, um, always think we're right.
      
      
         I know about that!
         Now what about your mom?
         Were you close with her when you were growing up?
      
      
         I was closer with my dad when I was little, just because I did all the sports and everything like that and, I've always been close to my mom, it was never like I didn't like my mom, but, um, me my mom and I never really fight or anything like that, but now me and my mom are a lot closer.
         When I started doing like the whole shopping thing, the make-up thing, everything like that, me and my mom got really, really close.
         And then, like now that I'm in college, like I call her, like all the time and it won't occur that I should talk to my dad, too!
         But, then like me and my mom will talk all the time and she'll come over here and she'll like have a beer and a cigarette with me and it doesn't matter anymore!
         
         Just because, you know, she knows how I am, I guess.
      
      
         Do you think that's hard for your dad maybe that you're closer with your mom now than you are your dad?
         Or do you think he kind of understands that's just the way?
      
      
         Um, it was hard for him at first, I think because, um, like all of a sudden I was like so into softball, so into sports and everything like that and I'm still like, I'm still like that.
         But it wasn't like "Daddy's Little Wannabe Tomboy," thing anymore, you know.
         Like, I started doing more things with my mom: I started doing this and I started doing that.
         I think that was kind of hard for him, you know.
      
      
         Do you think he resents that now or--?
      
      
         I don't think he resents it, I think he kind of had to suck it up and get it over with, get over it.
      
      
         
            
         
      
      
         Because like he saw that like, I think he saw that I was like him before I would admit that I was like him.
         Because he knew that I was going to do what I wanted to do without disrespecting my parents or do anything like that because I was still like not going to run out in a rampage and kind and be like a horrible person, but it was just like my life now and--
      
      
         And what's your major?
      
      
         Theater.
      
      
         Theater?
         How do they feel about your being a Theater major?
      
      
         Uh, funny.
         Actually my first semester at Charlotte, I was a Pre-Business major to go into Marketing and Advertising, because I did that in high school, too.
         But I never wanted to do that.
         I did that because that's what my dad wanted me to do.
         And `cause I was really involved in theater and stuff in high school and everything like that.
         And kind of like coming in to college or whatever, he kind of convinced me that what else am I going to do?
      
      
         Uh-huh.
      
      
         If I, he's like, "You're not going to do anything, da-da-da."
         He wasn't real supportive about it at all.
         But, um, after my first semester was over with and I had like a real Theater class, I knew that's what I still wanted to do.
      
      
         Really?
      
      
         And so I changed my major without telling my parents.
      
      
         Oh gosh!
      
      
         Then they got the whole schedule thing for the next year with the tuition bill on it and everything like that and my mom was reading it and it said, "Major THEA," and she was like, "What is this?"
         She knew I was going to do it, but Dad was pretty irate.
         Then I started paying him half the tuition bill.
         So--
      
      
         Really?
      
      
         Yeah.
         That was the deal for them to get off my back and let me do what I wanted to do.
         I pay half of my, everything.
      
      
         Was that hard for you?
      
      
         Yeah.
         Because my whole first year, I didn't work.
         But then, ha, ha that changed quickly.
         Well, actually when I went the whole first year, the whole first semester, because I worked at the pool on campus for a year.
      
      
         Uh-huh.
      
      
         That was horrible.
      
      
         Uh-huh.
      
      
         Because I'm like a lifeguard every summer and this year I had to get a winter job all year.
         And it's hard to go from having like your whole day to go to classes and do whatever you want to do and space out everything then like having to like drive across town and go to work.
         Just to be able to have a job, because I'm not a big work fan.
         That's probably why I'm a theater major so I can kind of, you know, do what plays I want and then move on.
      
      
         Do you think they've become more ex, do you think they've accepted more what you've decided to do or that's going to take a while?
         Or if they ever will at all?
      
      
         Um, my mom has because she knows how important it is to me and everything like that and my dad actually two weeks ago when I went home, I don't even remember why I went home, but I went home for something and he's like, he's still trying to convince me to double major.
         To have something to fall back on and everything like that.
         And I'm like, I'm trying to convince him to, you know, if I don't make it and there's a strong possibility I won't, I know that, I'm not stupid, I'm nor going to go to L.A. and make five million or more than that--
      
      
         
            Right.
         
         
      
      
         And do all that, and I mean, if I don't make it, my life's not going to be over or something, like I can't go back to school.
      
      
         So you'll go back to school if that doesn't work out?
      
      
         Yeah.
      
      
         Did you tell parents that?
      
      
         I think they know.
         My mom knows.
         My dad he, I don't know, he doesn't think I'm stupid, but he doesn't he wants better for me, than what he has.
         He thinks, you know, it's just kind of that whole thing, he wants me to get everything now, because he thinks once you're his age, it's too late.
         But he realizes it's not like that.
         He could go and make more his self if he would get off his butt and do it.
      
      
         What does he do?
         What does he do for a living?
      
      
         He's a brick mason, which he builds like buildings.
      
      
         Oh.
      
      
         And he's been doing that since he got out of the hospital.
         He went to college for two weeks and dropped out.
      
      
         Oh, you're kidding.
      
      
         Yeah.
         Like neither, like I'm the first one in my family to go to college on my dad's side.
      
      
         That must be a really big deal.
      
      
         Yeah.
         It is.
         That's why it's such like a big thing, because my uncle, he went, he went into the military and then came out.
         I don't know what, he sells like cars or something.
         
         And like my cousins like, one of my cousins, he's just like slack; he dropped out of high school his senior year.
         
      
      
         So, I'm kind of like the hope, I guess.
      
      
         That's a little bit of pressure, though.
      
      
         I guess.
         I don't, I kind of don't think about that though, because I'm like my life is my life, you know?
         And like my family's a big part of it.
         I love them all to death, but what they do, doesn't like reflect who I am--
      
      
         Right.
      
      
         --you know.
         And stuff like that.
         I'm kind of going to do what I'm going to do.
         That's why I stand out in my family.
         I think that's why they expect so much more of me.
         It kind of gets tiring and that's what I don't like, you know, I don't like to talk about myself when I go around my family.
         You know they're all like, "Oh good!
         Da-da-da-da-da."
         I'm like--
      
      
         Do they praise you a lot?
      
      
         Yeah.
      
      
         And you don't like that?
         I love it!
      
      
         I do, but it gets to a point where like I feel like if I fail, it's just going to be like way too much for everybody.
         And, I don't know, it's like my grandparents, I'm the youngest one.
         I'm the only girl, you know, besides my cousin's kids who are like two and three.
      
      
         Uh-huh.
      
      
         So nobody knows what they're going to be yet and considering Chris is raising them, that doesn't, you know, say too much for them two little girls.
         
      
      
         Whose girls?
      
      
         My cousin's.
         
      
      
         Oh.
         Oh yeah.
      
      
         
         I'm making my family sound really bad, but they're really not that bad!
      
      
         No!
         Everybody's family is different.
         What does your mom do?
      
      
         She's a, she works in a warehouse now, actually.
         She used to be a waitress for the longest, longest time.
         Now she works at US Aid.
         She does packages like First Aid stuff.
      
      
         Does she like what she does?
      
      
         Uh, no.
         
         No she doesn't at all.
         She waits tables like one night a week at another job to help put me through and everything like that.
         So--
      
      
         What do you do?
         Where, where are you working now?
      
      
         Now I'm starting my whole lifeguard thing this summer.
         I'm opening up like five pools and they're giving me a headache because they all turned green today, so, that's like the most fun job for me.
         This is the fourth summer I've done it.
         So now I'm going to run three pools over the summer.
      
      
         A big responsibility!
      
      
         Yeah, but I've done it for so long, I'm used to like lifeguard and like everything like that.
         Last year I managed one pool and the other pools are kind of small and like a few of our sisters are working for me.
         So that'll-- TAPE 1, SIDE B
      
      
         --work on stage and then go to L.A. and work in movies to begin with, anyway.
      
      
         So you wouldn't stay in Charlotte?
         Your parents will be sad!
      
      
         They know.
         I've told them.
         My dad still doesn't believe me.
         My mom believes me, because she knows I'll go.
         But, um, It's not like I'll never come back and visit or anything like that.
         Like, I mean, if let's say, I make it really big, you know, big, famous person or whatever, I'll live here.
         And then I'll go and everything like that, when I'm big enough to make my decisions on, when people are sending me scripts by then instead of me having to like audition and stuff.
      
      
         You have a good attitude about it, though!
         That's good, though, you need to, I guess.
      
      
         You can't go into it and be like, "Oh!
         I'm going to be a big movie star one day!"
         and everything like that, because the people like that are the ones that are disappointed the most and then like end up nowhere.
      
      
         Right.
      
      
         You know, like I know one day I'll have to sit down and decide if I'm where I want to be in life or if I'm not.
         And if I'm not, I've got to do something about it.
      
      
         That's a good attitude!
         Well, I definitely think you're going to do something with it and I want to thank you for talking to us.
      
      
         No problem!
      
      
         Bye!
      
   

   
   
      
         Can I please have your name?
      
      
         Tracy Blanchard.
      
      
         And your age?
      
      
         19.
      
      
         Where are you from in Charlotte?
      
      
         Concord.
      
      
         OK.
         And is there anything in particular you want to talk about?
         Are you a Freshman?
      
      
         Yes.
      
      
         OK.
         And did you like living in Charlotte all your life?
      
      
         Um, yeah.
         It's a nice place to grow up.
         Um, I don't think I'll be able to settle down here though, because most of my relatives live up north.
         So when I graduate, more than likely I'll move to Boston, but Charlotte has definitely been a nice place to live.
         I've never experienced any problems with crime or anything like that, and there's always been something for me to do, like in high school or in college, there's always things to go do, so it's been a nice place to grow up.
      
      
         Do you think it will be strange to move up north when you've lived in Charlotte all your life?
         Do you think there'll be a very big culture shock?
      
      
         I don't know that it will be a very big culture shock, because I've grown up going to Boston all the time.
         So it's almost like a second home.
         It won't be too different, but the style of the city is a little different, so--
      
      
         Um-hmm.
         Why wouldn't you want to stay on Charlotte?
         Is there any particular reason?
      
      
         I need a change.
         I've lived here all of my life.
         So I need a change and Boston's the place I've always looked to live at, so--
      
      
         Um-hmm.
         Do you feel that Charlotte has changed a lot since you were growing up here?
         Do feel like it's changed a lot?
      
      
         It's definitely grown.
      
      
         Uh-huh.
      
      
         And a lot more things have come up since then for people to do.
         So, I don't know.
      
      
         If you want to move so bad, why did you go to school here?
      
      
         Uh, the reason I choose to go to school here is because my parents live around 30 minutes away, and I wanted to be away from home, yet be able to go home, if I needed to, so--
      
      
         Uh-huh.
         Are you close to your family?
      
      
         Yes.
         Very close to my family.
         I usually go home once or twice a month.
      
      
         Don't you think that will be hard if you move all the way up there, not seeing them as much?
         Or do you feel you're ready for the change?
      
      
         Um, I'll definitely be ready for the change.
         I've been going up as a progress in school, so I, it will be a good change for me.
      
      
         So you'll stay here for the four years and then move, or would you transfer schools?
      
      
         Um, if I was able to get educational opportunities in school, I would transfer, but I'm happy with school here, with my sorority, with the city, with, I mean I'm happy with the way things are right now, so probably when I graduate.
      
      
         And what is it you want to do when you graduate?
      
      
         I would like to look for a job in education, possibly teaching elementary school, um, hopefully up north I would rather do that up north, so--
      
      
         How come?
         For any particular reason?
      
      
         I mean, just mostly because my family lives up there and I enjoy being up there.
      
      
         It won't bother you, the cold weather and stuff?
         I can say that because I'm from there.
         That won't bother you?
      
      
         It would definitely be an adjustment, but I've been up there with the weather before, and, um, I'm not, it's not hard for me to adjust to things so--
      
      
         Do you like the weather in Charlotte?
         Do you enjoy--?
      
      
         Oh, I definitely like the weather in Charlotte, so that would be kind of a shock for me to have those winters, but I'll be able to adjust to it.
         Although I do enjoy Spring and March here.
         
      
      
         How was it going to high school in Charlotte?
         Do you feel like, do you think it would have been different if you had gone to school in Boston or someplace else up north?
      
      
         I guess, actually it would, because in high school, I was on a State cheerleading championship squad, and they don't have squads like that up north as much, my cousins tell me from their high school.
         So I think it would definitely been different, just because of that.
      
      
         Do you feel like that's a Southern thing or a NC thing, or--
      
      
         Well, I actually kind of having guys on a cheerleading squad in high school is more a Southern thing, because my cousins in Boston had never heard of that before me, so--
      
      
         Uh-huh.
         So you feel like it's a southern thing?
         Because in NY, where I'm from, they do not, cheerleading and that stuff isn't as big as it is down here.
      
      
         Well, that was a big part for me in high school, so, I definitely think it would have made a difference it I had lived up there for high school.
      
      
         So was an important part of being in high school?
      
      
         Oh!
         That was my life!
         It truly was my life in high school.
      
      
         And it was an important aspect, was there a particular crowd that hung out because of that?
      
      
         Oh yes.
         It was the little popular crowd, you know, the little "we're better than everybody else" crowd.
         I hate to say that, but it is true!
         
      
      
         What about the people that didn't do that?
      
      
         I mean, I wasn't a particular snobby one, but there were some that were, so--
      
      
         So it was the cheerleaders dated the football players?
      
      
         Yeah.
         
         It really was.
         It was the stereotypical high school.
      
      
         It was?
         And do you feel like it was a good thing to grow up around?
      
      
         No.
         I really don't.
         You should really give everybody a chance.
         Just because they don't have as much money as you, or they don't do the same things as you do, doesn't mean they're not a good person inside.
      
      
         The money aspect is that, in your high school, did that affect stuff, how a person fit in or--?
      
      
         It really did, because a lot of the people on my group, their friends were well off.
         They had awesome cars and they strutted around with their awesome clothes and the other people who didn't really didn't hang out with our group of friends.
      
      
         Does that make for a lot of pressure to have a lot of money?
      
      
         It does!
         Because my family is by no means rich, but we never had that much trouble, so--.
         You always wanted to have the update styles clothes and the updated car.
         You want to be down anymore than anybody else, so--
      
      
         Is there anything else you wanted to talk about?
         High school or college?
      
      
         I guess I want to say that it's been a real positive experience living here, because my, my mother really wants to move back up north because that's where she's from.
         But my father loves the South, so, I guess it would be an adjustment for him if they moved so--.
         Charlotte's a good city, it's expanding and it's getting better.
         UNCC is a good school, it's probably the right size, I wouldn't want to go to a bigger school so--.
         I enjoy UNC-Charlotte.
      
      
         Well, thank you for sharing your experiences with me and your time.
         I appreciate it, Tracy.
      
   

   
   
      
         OK.
         If you could state your name and your um, date of birth your age and where you were born and where, just basically, just a brief sketch of all the places you've lived, real quickly if you can.
      
      
         Raymond Borel Junior, born September 20th 1968.
         They tell me at Riverside Memorial Hospital or something in NJ.
         There I resided until 1970 um, '70 or one when we moved to northeastern PA more specifically a little squirt of a town called Laceyville and there I lived until I was seven, 16 in 1985 and I moved here to Belmont, NC.
         
      
      
         And how, OK can you tell me any flood stories about growing up in Penn?
      
      
         Oh, we lived uh, not far from the Susquehanna River where our church was down that way, Skinners Eddy United Methodist Church specifically and I don't know if it was in the year that the king died there in '77 or if it was '78, but a flood came and course the kids were all you know told to leave school, parents would come get you, the buses ran special routes and so forth.
         I remember going down to the church and there was a group of men there that were organizing an uh, evacuation of all the valuables of the church, take them to the second floor.
         We had a large tractor-trailer parked out front and uh,
         these guys all assembled to take the pews out of the church.
         Well, of all these groups of adults there now.
         I'm maybe, I'm maybe nine, 10 years old and uh, of all these adults assembled there not one of them had a pair of pliers or a wrench.
         I fortunately remembered when Mom and I left to go to the church to bring a wrench and couple pairs of pliers because of course the pews were bolted to the floor.
         This as a young child kind of stunned me you know that we're going to go evacuate pews from a church and we're not going to bring any tools with us of course this was predating Makita battery tools looking back in retrospect we could have used Makita tools would have been far more productive but carrying the pews out of that church and loading them in that truck and by the time we got done the trailer wheels were covered with water and uh, we just kind of made it by the skin of our teeth that we got everything out of there.
      
      
         Yeah, um, how about because I know weather always reeked uh, certainly during the wintertime and all of the snowstorms that would come uh.
         \\
      
      
         // Ah yeah, fond, fond memories.
         \\
      
      
         One of my favorite,
         one of my favorite stories is the one about with you and my brother Ryan, the one day that you went sledding.
      
      
         Sleigh riding down a uh, property line that divided our house, our land from another neighbor that was kind of a, a swell or a ditch if you will there and that would freeze the water would freeze in that so you basically had a uh, like a luge, is that what it is?
      
      
         Uh-huh.
      
      
         Ice with a little bit of snow on top of it and we were in a little toboggan sled there not the, not the kind roll up there like a plastic sheet, but a boat sled.
      
      
         Right.
      
      
         And uh, we, we were moving pretty quickly down through there and I happened to glance up the road and there was a car coming.
         So,
         I have my sister's kid here and I'm going to kill him underneath this vehicle shortly.
         
         So we uh, through tremendous diversionary tactics of dragging my leg and my elbow and so forth we managed to stop just at the, the edge of the road after blistering my elbow on a big knot of ice but uh, I don't think Marsha knew about that until a few years ago I guess I don't know it's been a while but uh, yeah the snow there in the winters were exciting to say the least.
         I remember many mornings walking down to the bus where you know whatever you had in your nose would freeze.
         It would just crunch and you went to blow your nose nothing liquid came out it was crystals and you'd get on the school bus and it would be so damn cold that the floor of the bus would just be a solid sheet of ice you'd have rock salt scattered on the floor of the bus in order to keep some kind of traction and uh, had a couple of deviant children there on the bus and one's name was Robbie Share.
         He would pick chewing gum up off the floor and chew it disgusting things he was a deviant little sucker.
         And uh, I don't remember
         the specifics as to what he did, but the bus driver Louie was about four and a half feet tall driving a 72-passenger
         diesel bus.
         Uh, he would, he would try to straighten out Robbie, so he would call Robbie up to the front of the bus and he'd tell him, "Boy, I want you to sit there on that top step don't say a sound, don't make a sound, don't move, I don't want to even know you're there."
         And every stop we make, now you got to remember when those bus doors open what little heat that's in that bus goes out that door and the cold comes in.
         
         "Every time we stop I want you to get off and let whoever I'm letting on, in and then you get back in, sit on the step."
         All the way through that hour and 15 minute bus route old Robbie get off, he'd stand outside the bus, let the kids on and he'd get back in.
         I don't know whatever became of Robbie, not much I imagine.
         And then snow, ice uh, I can remember me and another boy once we got about sixth or seventh grade we'd stop uh, you couldn't run with chains on your bus on state maintained highways.
         You can do that on your, on your county roads and I think they call them a borough if I remember right up that way.
         Um, you could run with chains on those secondary roads um, but once you got on a state road you couldn't, so it would be a point in our bus route that we would have to get out and it would be you know, I don't know 20, 25 degrees, wind blowing and we'd help Louie get the chains off the bus.
         That was you know, you kind of felt important at that point because you've, you've graduated to next level of adolescence, you're now helping the bus driver.
         We uh, we would run our safety drills at the elementary school.
         
         And uh, the elementary school, as you got to the high school, of course that was different than it is down here, our elementary school only ran until sixth grade and we went to the high school building at seventh grade so you had seven through 12 all in one big building.
         Of course you only had a thousand students through all those six grades.
      
      
         Uh-huh.
      
      
         But once you got to that point you still stopped at the elementary school and we would help those kids get off the bus, we would have emergency drills and that sort of thing.
         You would open the back door and you felt like you were big stuff.
         We had one spot on our route at the top of Browntown Mountain which was about a two mile drag downhill which, you know could be deadly for large trucks or cars on ice in any situation.
         I can remember sitting there and Louie saying, "Everybody be quiet, shut-up."
         It would be so damn foggy you could not see the yellow line on that divided highway in front of you and we to turn left out onto this highway.
         We would all slide the windows down on the bus open the door, stick your head out the door, you couldn't hear anything coming that way, you couldn't hear anything coming the other way, and he'd just drop it in low and gun it, we would make it another morning.
         That seems like that was two or three weeks out of the school year in the spring especially that the fog would just be outrageous.
         We never had any uh,
         never had any problems.
         I can remember it being so cold again that uh, one circumstance coming from uh, Springhill where I live down into town which was Laceyville, the bus wouldn't run, it kept cutting off it was diesel.
         It was so cold that the fuel does what they call congeals, the fuel becomes like gelatin.
         We'd basically coasted down into town and got about 50 gallons of kerosene and pumped it in the fuel tank so that so that the fuel would actually run through the fuel lines and the bus would run.
         And you're going to school in those conditions.
      
      
         Right.
      
      
         That was uh, that was the most exciting part of you know, most important, most exciting part of going to school was getting there for me.
         
         Alive.
      
      
         How about um, your motorcycle?
      
      
         Um, yes y'all need to include that picture with my little dysentery here, uh disinter, I guess it is.
         
         
         I guess it was 1979, my dad bought me a little Yamaha 80 motorcycle I could cruise through the fields and dirt roads and so forth which uh, I had real good luck with that I guess up until um, I don't know what year that was there.
         Groundhog hole found the front tire of the motorcycle and I managed to fly over the handlebars.
         I guess I lay there unconscious awhile.
         I don't remember, but only, only a fractured collarbone, which I recommend to anyone that needs to break a bone, break a collarbone.
      
      
         Uh-huh.
      
      
         It's a relatively painless experience and not very cumbersome to deal with, not bad.
         My son reminds me of a story I told him or I think his grandmother told him.
         Our neighbor had a pool and we were kind of like the Hatfield's and McCoy's, they weren't very nice people and they didn't like us.
         I guess I had a friend staying overnight.
         We thought it would be cool to see just how far a BB would shoot.
         
         
         Well we found out a couple of days later when the neighbor walked over and informed my dad that he found BB in the filter pump of his swimming pool.
         So I guess they went that far.
         We lived in uh, in dairy land country and uh, little things you missed which now I don't know if I like or not.
         We had a barn, a dairy farm that was maybe quarter of a mile from the house and uh, Mama say, "We need milk."
         Well, the town was three miles away and the barn was a 1,000 feet, so you grab your little stainless steel kettle with a lid on it and a handle.
         You'd walk down the road with a dollar bill in your hand now this is in the mid-seventies, but still milk was twice that in the store I guess.
      
      
         Uh-huh.
      
      
         You'd go down to this big stainless steel vat that was would hold a thousand gallons of milk then you'll pull the lid of this vat and lower you're kettle down in to it.
         Ice cold milk and uh, pull it out of course it was whole milk and cream on top.
         If you forgot to shake it in the morning your cereal was kind of disgusting.
      
      
         Yeah.
      
      
         It was kind of like eating it with whipping cream.
         But I know uh, your father used to love it.
         You couldn't leave it if you didn't rinse your glass out after you got drinking after you got done drinking it would stick to the glass to the point where you'd have to scrape it.
         Now they tell you that's not good to do.
         You shouldn't drink that non-pasteurized milk, but hey, it never hurt us.
      
      
         Um, what other, now I know you worked with your dad in the beginning there when you were quite younger.
      
      
         Um, 12 or 13.
      
      
         Your father is a, a builder.
      
      
         Uh-hum.
      
      
         And, and you took up the trade too.
      
      
         Met my first girlfriend that way.
         Walked through her bedroom around 6:30, seven o'clock in the morning you know.
      
      
         Really?
      
      
         Yeah.
         We were putting siding on her house and beat on the door nobody comes to the door it's summertime everybody sleeping until 10:00.
         We're there early in the morning to beat the heat.
         I got to get the windows open in order to pin, bend the metal around them and so forth this girl and I had always had a love hate relationship on the bus,
         I love to hate her.
         And uh, me and my friend there we'd always sit together in the first or second seat on the bus.
         Well when she, we would pick her up on the route, she'd want to sit with us.
         It was the closest seat, she was only on the bus a few minutes and then we were dumping the elementary kids and we had plenty of room again.
         So she, we would always fuss about her sitting with us but anyway this one morning I putting siding dad and I are putting siding on her house and nobody come to the door.
         The door was unlocked and I had to get the windows open, so I just kind of go cruising through the house upstairs try to find my way to the window.
         Well that window happened to be through her room, so I just kind of walked on through the room and she looked up at me and I said, "Good morning," and she just screamed.
         I went on through, unlocked the window
         and left.
         Later we laughed about it, but wasn't really funny at the time for her I guess.
         
      
      
         
         Do you remember the first jobs that you, that you did um, because, I, did you, I don't think you started working with your dad did you?
         You got a job cutting siding wasn't it?
      
      
         Well that was for Dad.
         Yeah, he had a guy that would help him on Wednesdays, it was the local barber.
         He was paying him five bucks an hour and he would, he could work all day Wednesday and uh, but I believe it was on that job there, that Kavalo, that Dad said, "Look boy you can read a tape measure better that this forty year old man can so I'll give you five bucks an hour if you prove you can do it."
         Excuse me.
         "You can prove what you can do."
      
      
         Yeah.
      
      
         So after two or three days he called Callgrove and said, "Don't bother coming in I found a guy better than you."
         Well when Callgrove found out it was me that, that kind of hurt his feelings a little you know, but ever since then Pop and I worked all summers, every summer, we did the Kavalo job, then we built a barn the following year for the Reamuses down on the river.
         I fell off that roof, there's a little miracle, I missed a boulder by about six inches which would have probably shattered my spine when I fell off that, but you get, you're lucky, everybody's here for a reason just what condition you're in when you're still here.
         Fortunately I'm all in functioning.
      
      
         Yeah.
      
      
         All my digits um, still work.
      
      
         Do you remember?
         
      
      
         I didn't, oh, I, when I was a kid I don't even remember that son,
         I only heard about it.
      
      
         Do you remember any stories or do you have any stories about your grandparents?
      
      
         Uh, not so much stories about Grandmom and Grandpop, um--
      
      
         Because they were living in a, in an apartment basically.
      
      
         Yeah, when I was about 12, I guess I was 11 or 12.
         I went and stayed with Grandmom and Grandpop Borel in their little two bed, one bedroom apartment in NJ and uh, I guess I stayed five or six days.
         Grandmom smoked Saratoga 120 cigarettes which are about eight and a half inches long.
         Grandpop was a very quiet, somber man he wouldn't say much but uh, Gra ndmom was a little more boisterous.
         They had a small poodle named Fifi, it was disgusting,
         but I learned uh, you know how you learn respect for, for people in, in, different ways um, for you know, for all Grandpop didn't say much Grandpop had more love and affection for that dog and showed it to that dog probably more than most parents show to their kids today.
         I mean man had hip replacements and bad knees and everything else and he'd get on his knees and play with that dog and give it it's medicine, put peanut butter on his finger and feed it to that dog to keep that dog alive.
         Um, I know a lot of people wouldn't, couldn't I mean and for him he wouldn't have bent down to pick up a quarter because it would have hurt him too much.
      
      
         Yeah.
      
      
         Um, but he'd bend down and stay down to help that dog.
         My grandmom was pretty much a chain smoker.
         She uh, she'd had laryngitis and the doctor told her if you don't quit smoking you'll never talk.
         She told him to shut-up and get her a pack of cigarettes.
         She got gangrene in her foot and he said if you don't quit smoking you're going to lose your foot.
         She said, "I'm going shoe shopping," and kept on smoking.
         Died with both feet and talking the whole way.
         Uh, // she would have smoking all the whole way.
         //
      
      
         // Smoking the whole way.
         // Yeah.
      
      
         And that time I spent with them was the coolest because grandmom would let me smoke and at 12, 13 years old
         you know being able to
         sit there and smoke cigarettes with grandma.
      
      
         Do you smoke her Saratogas?
      
      
         Oh yeah, man they were good cigarettes.
         Now that was uh, man the most flavorful cigarette I'd ever smoked, course at 12 what did you ever smoke you know?
         
         But uh, come mealtime boy this little apartment with central air conditioning running, the smoke hung about four and a half five feet down from the ceiling.
         I mean literally you could just see it hang, it looked like a fire scene on the news it was awful.
         I mean you have smoked potatoes and smoked roast beef, smoked sandwiches, smoked syrup, everything tasted like smoke.
         And clothes, everything just reeked of it especially if you went outside for 15 minutes and actually got huh, fresh smog.
         SF: Yeah.
      
      
         And then came back in oh my gosh the second hand smoke in there was enough to kill uh, a farm full of people.
         Terrible.
      
      
         Well, I think what was worse about their place is not only the smoke hanging in the air, but they kept it at // 80 degrees.
         //
      
      
         // Uh-hum.
         It was always warm.
         //
      
      
         // All the time.
         // Even in the in, I mean NJ winters are really cold but--
      
      
         And Grandpop would complain that it was still cold in there.
      
      
         Yeah.
      
      
         At 80 he was still cold.
      
      
         Yeah.
      
      
         He liked it a little warmer.
         Not too many stories about Grandmom and Grandpop though they were pretty quiet.
      
      
         Do you remember any stories about Grandma Mackton, your mom's a little bit?
      
      
         The only stories I remember about
         Grandmom Mackton would be uh, when uh, Grandpop Mackton uh, he was a watch repairman and so forth and this was even actually before my time, I remember this just being translated to me from my dad um, my sisters Marsha and Rayona would be over there visiting with my mom and dad, and Grandpop would be working on a watch and he'd drop a part.
         Now you can picture the part out of a watch how small this is and for a guy that in his probably sixties at that point difficult for him to see, lighting in that day and time not being what it is now, of course he'd lose his part and he'd say, "Tootles," well first he'd have his fit, "Nothing but damn junk, junk, junk!"
         He'd say about these watches he was fixing, "Nothing but a bunch of GD junk."
         I can remember Mom and Dad saying Grandmom in the kitchen hollering, "Daddy, Daddy, Daddy I wish you wouldn't talk like that in front of the girls."
         Then Grandpop, he'd calm down, "Tootles, you see this part here.
         I dropped one of those sons of bitches on the floor again.
         
         Can you find one just like it for Grandpa?"
         And he, they would get down there and they'd find it and find it for him.
         I remember too Dad say that Grandmom would fuss at him for giving the girls money, I say I don't remember now how much it was but if pack of cigarettes was 15 cents he'd give the girls a quarter.
      
      
         Uh-huh.
      
      
         Now this is going back to the fifties and early sixties when you could still do that but he'd send these young girls, 10 or 11 years old maybe, down to the general store and get him a pack of cigarettes well, with the change they could buy licorice and candy and what not.
         "Daddy, Daddy, Daddy send those girls to get those filthy cigarettes."
         "Well they get candy, Mom."
         
         You know that's how he justified it, they were getting something out of it.
         He wasn't sending them there for nothing.
         I'm told I'm a lot like him.
         Which I don't know I never met him, don't remember him.
      
      
         How about do remember any stories that, that you've been told by your, by your sisters about them growing up or have they told stories about you growing up that you can remember?
      
      
         Well, some of them that uh, with your mother Marsha uh, I she was, I believe about 18 when I was born.
         I was a mistake.
         An oops.
         And uh, everyone you know going out to eat or anything like that then uh, the waiter would say to my parents, "What would you like, what would you like?"
         and then they ask my sister what would she like for my son.
         She'd go, "Oh no, he's not mine.
         He's their's."
         You know she wasn't going to claim me.
         
         My sister had uh, an apartment in NJ and I remember there was, she had a roommate, young girl which hindsight is 20/20 she used to say she was going to kidnap in the middle of the night, put me in bed with her.
         I would just scream and scream you know that, "No, no, don't do that."
         But stories I remember hearing one of uh, I believe it was Marsha uh, the wind caught the storm door there she was, she was uh, hanging on to the back storm door and I guess pulled it open a little bit to see what was going on and the wind caught it and threw her right out in the yard.
      
      
         Yard.
      
      
         Hello.
         I don't know uh, any other fantastic tales that I have.
      
      
         How about um, your kids?
         You've got three kids now.
         
      
      
         Uh-huh.
         Yeah.
         
      
      
         Born and raised in, in uh, // NC.
         //
      
      
         // NC.
         // The fine county of Gaston.
         Yeah, I have a son that uh, likes to relive the tragedy of his split lip.
         Um, took a little spill and had to get a stitch, huh?
      
      
         Uh-huh.
      
      
         Huh, yeah.
         But uh, no they've had pretty uneventful childhoods, I think we've had our moments of comedy.
      
      
         Yeah.
      
      
         We were helping my niece and nephew paint a new house that they bought and uh, he uh, little Raymond was with us.
         He said, "Daddy I have to go poo-poo."
         And I said, "Well son the Port-o-john is way down there in the neighborhood.
         Hold it as long as you can.
         
         Tell me when you feel it peeping out and then we'll run like hell."
         
         And my one sister Rayona she reminds me of that story and laughs every time we tell it.
         
         But you held it didn't you?
      
      
         Um-huh.
      
      
         I don't know, do I have any other fantastic stories I've told you?
      
      
         I'm trying to remember.
         I can, well you know we just relived the story today of when you built the house over on um, // Songbird.
         //
      
      
         // Songbird.
         // We were there working.
      
      
         And the day that you put the, the shower and the tub in.
         Do you remember that?
      
      
         Um, yeah when Dad busted my ear because he stopped moving.
      
      
         Yeah.
      
      
         Yeah.
         And those moments of idiotic stupidity we uh, we put some scaffolding out on the front of the house and uh, I just shot a two-by-four out the side of the house with a couple of nails in it and got out there and climbed on top of it.
         There's, my dad reminds me from time to time.
         What if those nails would have pulled out?
         But fortunately they didn't.
         One story does come to my mind though where you painted the foundation coating on the house and got tar all over you.
         
         Do you remember that?
      
      
         Yeah.
      
      
         And you said, "How do I get this tar off of me uncle?"
         I said, "Well you can use paint thinner or turpentine or gasoline."
         "Well what do you have?"
         I said, "Well we got some // gasoline."
         //
      
      
         // Gasoline.
         //
      
      
         So you.
      
      
         I thought it was lacquer thinner.
      
      
         No it was gas because you washed your legs all over because you did it in shorts.
      
      
         It was a hot day.
      
      
         Then the next day I don't know if you weren't there.
      
      
         No, I worked.
         My ankle.
      
      
         But you ended up with blood poisoning from all the gasoline.
      
      
         Yeah.
         Throwing up.
      
      
         Um, the joys, joys and fun of construction.
      
      
         Construction.
      
      
         Your brother came to help us there.
         Ninety-four degrees outside I got nothing on but a jock strap,
         I'm still dying it's so hot.
         You're sweating.
         Grandpop's drowning, I mean everything on him is soaking wet and Ryan's got on a long, honest to God he had on a long sleeve shirt with the collar buttoned up.
      
      
         I know.
         I think he had on a short sleeve.
         I know he had on blue jeans.
      
      
         Yeah, I know he had on pants, he had on a long sleeve I think the cuffs were rolled up once or twice.
      
      
         Yeah.
         I couldn't have done it.
      
      
         I would have died.
         I'd a screamed.
      
      
         Because that was, we would wake up at, at six in the morning.
      
      
         We'd be sitting there waiting on daylight to be able to go to work.
      
      
         Couldn't some mornings, couldn't even see just hoping that it would be cooler.
      
      
         Yeah.
      
      
         And the afternoon would come around around two.
      
      
         Oh yeah, I want to quit early today.
      
      
         We would be there until // five, // six o'clock at night.
      
      
         // Five.
         // Well it's starting to get cool now that's how you justify it.
      
      
         Go in for an extra long lunch.
         How about the day that um, how about the day that I would, to help you with the two by six's.
         Rafters out on the back porch and I went to reach a board to hand it you and another board slipped.
         Do you remember that?
         It fell right across my foot.
      
      
         Oh yeah!
         Did a number on your toe didn't it?
      
      
         Yeah.
      
      
         Your mother wasn't real happy about that.
      
      
         I think we hid it from her didn't we?
      
      
         Yeah, you didn't tell her too much about it until later that you smashed your foot up pretty bad.
         I forgot about that.
         Grandpop slipped through the floor joists there too.
      
      
         That's right.
         
      
      
         That did a number on the inside of his leg.
      
      
         That one time you were trying to take that floor joist.
         You had put some type of beam between the two floor joists and you went to hit it with a hammer and you were hitting it backwards and it smacked it into your chest.
      
      
         Smacked my chest.
         Oh I've done that a number of times.
         Had my head up between ceiling joists nailing rafters glanced off the rafter and hit myself in the head with a hammer.
      
      
         How about um, how about this story of Grandpop and his son, of your dad?
      
      
         Oh yeah.
         That was when we first moved here to NC we uh, had a job across the street from where we build him a house uh, Truman house.
         And uh, we were borrowing a guy's saw, chop saw, miter saw and um, I upstairs nailing down trim and I hear the saw every once in a while so I know he's down there working and all of a sudden don't hear the saw and I run out of new trim.
         "Are you down there?"
         I look nobody is standing at the saw.
         I look around well he was right here.
         I see a few drops of blood on the floor.
         I look out the window and there he's booking across the yard heading for the house.
         I get over to the house.
         He said that saw drifted down and hit him right across the back of his thumb.
      
      
         Ouch.
      
      
         Yeah so he's kind of standing there at the kitchen sink and my mom's running around like a chicken with her head cut off.
         
         "Need a Band-Aid, need some gauze, need some tape."
         Well she can't find any of it.
         My mom's not real organized when it comes to things like that.
         
         Band-Aids are at the kitchen sink, the peroxide is in the basement you know, the gauze is in the bathroom and the tape for that is upstairs.
      
      
         Right.
      
      
         Oh lord, she's running around carrying on well, Dad makes the mistake of looking at his wound and his knees go out from under him.
         He buckles down onto the floor.
         I think uh-oh 200 pounds of mush going to be laying on the floor,
         I'll never get him up you know.
         
         So we quick think and I go, well grab a paper towel and wet it and throw a couple of ice cubes in and put it on his hand, get him up to his feet and haul him off to the emergency room.
         Well meantime my Mom is running around she doesn't hardly know that we left.
         She's still looking for Band-Aids.
         
         Take him to the First Med Place.
         They stitch him up good went back to work later that afternoon.
         He's a trooper that way he, that doesn't make any difference as far as him being hurt he'll work.
      
      
         Yeah.
      
      
         He'll work it off.
         I remember um, one of the best trips we had, which was why we've since created the Borel Family Reunion, was a funeral we had a funeral for my grandfather, Grandpop Borel.
         My sisters and I decided we would all ride up together in // the upchuck wagon.
         You were there, the upchuck wagon.
         //
      
      
         // I think yeah, Ryan and I were there.
         // Yeah now you have to explain the upchuck wagon.
      
      
         I believe it was a Dodge wasn't it?
      
      
         If my father bought it, it would have to be a Dodge.
         
      
      
         Yes that's true.
      
      
         It was a Chevy.
      
      
         // Oh.
         //
      
      
         // It was a Chevy.
         // A Chevy conversion van at 70 miles an hour would make the freakiest noises which would wake my sister up to prompt her to poke me and tell m e to slow down.
         
         And uh, somewhere in the middle of VA.
      
      
         Because we were driving from // NC all the way up to Riverside, NJ.
         //
      
      
         // NC all the way up to Riverside, NJ.
         // Of course we had to do it in a day because we couldn't take enough time everybody.
         Somewhere in VA Marsha sees a billboard for this restaurant to eat at.
         It's a very attractive billboard, but it was not anything franchised where you could actually say, "Oh yes I know that."
         So we took a chance on it and started following the billboards.
         I swear to God it must have been 17 miles later, like on three secondary roads, down a dirt road, at the end of a trail was this nice kind of western looking restaurant that we ended up eating at.
         I believe that there was a pond even that it kind of overlooked in the back.
         It was kind of, it was nice.
         But it kind of killed an hour out of our trip as far as time, but we had a lot of fun at that uh, that funeral.
         I had a cousin there that had a, he was I guess in his twenties and uh, he loaded the trunk of his car with beer and after the funeral we all kind of stood out in the parking lot drinking beer, smoking cigarettes and it wasn't um, until after Grandmom died and uh, we were sitting at uh, a cousin's house, sitting in his basement and um, his name was Raymond Ward and he was kind of hosting the post funeral procession there that goes on.
         And I said to some of my cousins that I had only the last I had seen was at Grandpop's funeral.
         I said, "You know, this really sucks we all have a really good time and it's a really sad occasion.
         Why don't we do this in spite of not don't have a funeral let's just get together."
         And we were just sitting there and the majority of the family at that point lived in PA and the rest of it lived here in NC and sitting there with him we just kind of said, "You know we ought to find a place in the middle."
         And uh, my parents and I had stopped many times in a little town called New Market, VA which was just a // little, // yeah it seemed like a halfway point.
      
      
         // Halfway.
         //
      
      
         And uh, so we uh, put some plans together.
         My older sister Rayona she put together that reunion.
         Turns out it was 226 miles to New Market from PA and 320 miles from NC to New Market.
         And now we can sit around drink beer by the pool, smoke cigarettes and tell stories without somebody dying.
      
      
         Right.
      
      
         But I know, ironically I don't think, why in fact I know we had one reunion and then we lost a family member that Raymond Ward that we met at his house.
         Any more interesting stories you know that I tell?
      
      
         I was just, well I always thought the one with um, about Aunt Ann and the bird.
      
      
         Aunt Ann and the bird?
      
      
         The bird that, that flew into the house.
      
      
         Oh well that was Rosemary, her mother was gone.
         They lived across the street from us in PA.
         That's my dad's brother and uh, his family and um, one of his daughters call over there and she says, "We got a bird stuck in the house and it won't get out."
         And Aunt Ann has a lot of knick-knacks.
      
      
         Uh-hum.
      
      
         A lot of crystal and plates and she had a plate rail in the dining room that ran around, you know so far down from the ceiling and that damn little bird would walk behind those plates and you, you just knew he was going to knock a plate knock off, a plate off but he never did.
         Chased him all the way up to the upstairs, I don't think the bird ever even pooped in the house not that we found--
      
      
         Wow.
      
      
         Not that we found, but he got upstairs in the house and we locked in the bedroom and opened all the windows in the bedroom and after about half an hour it kind of ran out, but I don't think Aunt Ann ever noticed that.
         I don't think Aunt Ann noticed that bird was ever in the house.
         
      
      
         I won't tell.
         
         We won't let her see the tape.
      
      
         OK.

         Uh-huh.
      
      
         
         Do you ever, do you have any stories that, do you remember any stories that Daddy used to tell you or that daddy tells you?
      
      
         Sometimes I, I remember one story he told me in the yellow house.
      
      
         What was that?
      
      
         He told me that there was a ghost in it.
         
      
      
         He did?
         
         Did you ever see the ghost?
      
      
         Ugh-ugh.
      
      
         No.
         Did he ever tell you any other stories?
      
      
         A book he said he read.
         The little pigs, The Three Little Pigs.
      
      
         The Three Little Pigs.
      
      
         Uh-huh.
      
      
         Does Daddy do voices when he does Three Little Pigs?
      
      
         Yeah.
      
      
         Yeah.
         
         How about I used to read you stories a lot.
         Do you remember that?
      
      
         Uh-huh.
      
      
         Do you remember what kind of stories they were?
      
      
         Mmm, uh-huh.
      
      
         I think, I think your favorite was do you remember Maurice Sendak and we would read the about Pierre and the lion.
      
      
         Yeah that's one that I like.
      
      
         Do you remember little Pierre?
         What did Pierre always say?
         Do you remember?
      
      
         Ugh-Ugh.
      
      
         You don't?
      
      
         Pierre.
         
      
      
         Pierre he would always say, "I don't care."
      
      
         Pierre, Pierre, "I don't care."
         
      
      
         Uh-huh.
         
      
      
         And the lion ate him.
         
      
      
         Yeah he did, didn't he?
         And they had to take him to a hospital right.
      
      
         Yeah and the lion gave him a ride back home.
      
      
         Um-huh.
         That's right.
         Um, Christmas is coming up pretty soon huh?
         I heard that you were writing a Christmas list.
      
      
         Uh-huh.
      
      
         What kind of things are on your list?
      
      
         I don't know.
         
      
      
         
         You wrote this out all by yourself.
         Look at this.
         What?
         This is in cursive.
      
      
         I know.
      
      
         Did you write this?
      
      
         Um-huh.
      
      
         That's really impressive.
         I don't know if I can really read any of this though.
         Space, space?
         What is this?
      
      
         Bazooka.
      
      
         What is that?
         What's a space bazooka?
      
      
         It's this toy bazooka?
      
      
         Is it like a gun?
      
      
         Yeah, but it's not real.
      
      
         It's not real.
         Does it shoot things?
      
      
         No.
         It just goes boom, boom.
      
      
         Oh, that sounds like fun.
         What else is on this list here?
         A snowboard --.
      
      
         Um huh.
      
      
         For North Carolina?
      
      
         
         They say we're going up in the mountains to find some snow.
      
      
         Really?
      
      
         Uh-huh.
      
      
         When are you going to that?
      
      
         I think at Christmas and I'm getting a knife set.
         
      
      
         A knife set?
      
      
         Uh-huh.
      
      
         That sounds dangerous.
      
      
         But I'm never going to take the knives out.
      
      
         Oh, OK.
         That sounds like a good idea.
      
      
         There's a survival kit that I'm getting.
      
      
         Really.
      
      
         Uh huh.
         And.
         I got, get me a microscope that goes to the TV and it hooks up to the TV so you can put a bug under there and you can see it and big.
      
      
         Um-huh.
      
      
         You can put a ladybug and see a ladybug about that big on the television.
      
      
         Wow.
         That sounds like fun.
         Are you going to get gifts for anyone this year?

         Little Red Riding Hood.
         How does that story go?
      
      
         The big bad wolf ate the grandma then she, then the big bad wolf tried to, eat red riding hood.
      
      
         Really.
         Did the wolf ever eat her?
      
      
         Nope.
      
      
         No.
         Any other stories that you can remember?
      
      
         Uh-um.
      
      
         No.

         Thank you!
         
      
   

   
   
      
         Elbert Branch.
         Elbert, I just want to ask you uh, some questions about your experience with uh, stories.
         The first stories that you remember, um, stories that were read to you or told to you and who told them.
         What, what are some of the first stories you remember?
      
      
         Um, the one that really sticks out a lot is uh, before my parents had TV,
         their,
         I want to say it's their aunts and uncles who lived a mile up the dirt road had the first TV in the whole family and so after all the farm work was taken care of and everybody had dinner and that evening everybody would walk up the dirt road.
      
      
         How far away?
      
      
         It was a pretty good distance.
         I would say about a mile.
         Um.
         They were off up the hill a little ways.
         And in between the houses you had this pasture where they kept the cows and bulls.
         And on this particular night, it was night, they, they had a bull out there that was pretty mean and would charge the fence at people.
         And um, Grandma, my grandmother, their mother, was walking with them that night.
         She was going to watch TV.
         And uh, it was dark, they really couldn't see.
         And uh, they were walking up the path and Grandma accidentally stepped in something
         that was really soft and her foot got to sinking and instead of her pulling that one foot back out and shaking it off to keep going, she stuck both feet in there and she started to holler.
         
         And my mother said all the kids took off running and left her.
         Because they heard the bull coming.
         The bull start making his noises and all that other stuff.
         
         And they said somehow, someway Grandma was with them when they got to the aunts and uncles house.
         So, but uh,
         mom would always sit us around at home at the evenings, um, and tell us about her days growing up.
         They walking to school in the rain, sleet, and snow, five miles and all this other crazy stuff--
      
      
         Uphill both ways.
      
      
         Yeah, uphill both ways.
         And how they use to take their lunches to school and some of the things they took for lunch like fatback meat biscuits and--.
      
      
         I forgot to ask you.
         Where is, where was this?
         Where did they grow up?
      
      
         They grew up in Lewisburg, NC, which is a little small town it's
         east of Raleigh.
         About 40 miles east of Raleigh.
      
      
         On a farm.
      
      
         On a farm and uh, she has some wild and crazy stories that she sat and shared with us.
         And um, they talked about how a quarter could buy them so much candy, cookies, drinks, and that stuff, and talked about some of the things, wild things that went on, on the farm, some of the ghost stories, the hankses they called them.
         They didn't call them ghosts.
         It was the hanks that they seen.
      
      
         These are dead people that are--
      
      
         I, at that time I,
         she just called them hanks.
         \\ They wasn't ghosts.
         Yeah.
         \\
      
      
         \\ Hanks, I never heard that.
         \\
      
      
         Hanks.
         Granddad had seen something one night.
         It was about seven or eight feet tall.
         He kept shining his light up.
         He never did see the head of it before he took off running so
         and uh, something that jumped on the back of the horses.
         She said it was a panther.
         You know, at that time I was like you, panther here in North Carolina?
         So jumped on one of the horses back.
         But it was a bunch of wild and crazy stories.
      
      
         Now where did you, when you were hearing these stories, your mother was telling them to you, where were you living at the time?
      
      
         We were staying here in Albemarle.
      
      
         OK.
      
      
         We grew up here in Albemarle.
         Myself, and my brother and sister.
         We moved from down there up here at a very young age and we don't remember a lot about the old as they call it their home.
         We call this our home because this is where we were raised at.
         But uh, we hear a lot about home and how it used to be and like I said walking five miles to school and--
      
      
         So don't complain Elbert.
      
      
         Yeah, don't complain.
         Um, the first book I guess I really remember is she bought us a Bible stories.
      
   

   
   
      
         OK.
         Umm, go ahead and tell me about a story.
      
      
         Well I can remember as a small child probably between the ages of three and seven going to Asheville and visiting my grandmother umm and my grandfather but he died when I was fairly young so I mostly remember visiting my grandmother.
         She lived in a small house in Asheville.
         Uh, it was pretty much a kitchen a front room and two-bedroom house one bathroom.
         The uh neighborhood she lived in was very uh quiet mostly older people and uh we used to go around the neighborhood and visit a lot of her old friends.
         Um one couple in particular the Blankenships had a apple tree in their back yard and we would go and we would pick apples and take them back to her place and make apple pies.
         The Blankenships were kind of an odd couple in that uh both of them chewed tobacco and spit into little spittoons.
         Uh, it's kind of weird talking to an elderly couple spitting tobacco, especially because one of them was female and you always had that impression that chewing tobacco was a guy thing.
         Uh,
         strange little memories like that about my grandmother's house.
         She had a washing machine but not, not a dryer so all the laundry get, got put hung out on the clothesline.
         Uh she had a big garage that was separate from the house and almost bigger than the house it was almost like it was a barn.
         And a bunch of my grandfather's old tools were in there odd things like, like scythes and things that you would find only on a farm even though the house itself was not on farmland.
         Uh, my grandmother had a `64 Nova which a most people would consider to be a muscle car but uh she only drove it maybe two to three miles at the most and it usually took the whole day to plan what would happen if she were to need to drive somewhere so this car had very little mileage on it even though it was, at that point, about 20 years old.
         Uh, we used to sit on her back porch and uh snap uh beans or what they called doing snap beans, uh, which was really just taking green beans and snapping them into smaller pieces.
         Uh, I suppose it had some kind of great significance.
         My sisters seemed to get a good kick out of it.
         Uh, we used to walk up to the local grocery store, uh, which was about three or four blocks away.
         There was also a candy store about three or four blocks in the other direction called Pud's that we used to walk up to and across the street from Pud's was the local fire department and the uh the firemen used to let us play on the fire engines which is completely unheard of nowadays but they let us you know climb all over them, get inside and honk the horns you know put on fire jacket and boots or whatever we wanted to do and uh I guess there just weren't a lot of fires in Asheville in that part of town because they never seemed to be concerned that we would be interfering with their preparedness.
         Um
         I don't know those are the, the sort of stick out in my mind about visiting Asheville.
         Um we always tended to stop somewhere scenic either going to or coming from.
         We went to Chimney Rock on a number of occasions.
         We went to Linville Caverns once and we went to Sliding Rock and Biltmore House and some of the other attractions that are up that way in the western part of the state.
         Uh I think we even went to Tweetsie Railroad a couple of times so, uh, you know the sort of just wholesome, down home kind of memories
         about visiting my grandmother before she got uh, unable to take care of herself and she ended up moving in with us.
         You know, but they're rather pleasant memories of childhood and I certainly wouldn't trade them for anything.
      
      
         Is there anything specific that, uh, you remember about your grandma?
      
      
         Mm.
      
      
         A specific story that she used to tell or?
      
      
         Not any stories that she used to tell.
         Um she was always a very active person.
         Um she used to, she used to walk every day.
         Um, she had grown up on the farm.
         She had uh, I believe she had 12 kids in her family.
         And uh, they were all very active very strong people and even though my grandmother was a tiny little woman, she was about 5'2", uh, she was pretty strong for her size and rugged and sturdy and that uh even carried over into her later years when mentally she wasn't all there but physically she was still extremely healthy and it was uh, kind of a strange kind of position to be in.
         Um I guess the thing I remember most about my grandmother's personality is that she was extremely frugal.
         She would save everything.
         One thing in particular she used to save would be soup labels.
         I guess there was one particular program where you would returned so many soup labels and they gave you a rebate or something on collecting aluminum cans.
         And uh she had just cartons and cartons of soup labels that she had saved over the years and redeem them you know I don't know
         five cents a bushel so she was very practical in that regard.
         Um, she always kept all her bills and expenses at an absolute minimum ran everything very efficiently kept an extremely tidy house uh.
      
      
         Is there anything your parents ever told you about her, stories that they ever did like when they were kids?
         Um, I guess when your father was a kid.
      
      
         Um, not too many stories about my dad's childhood.
         He spent most of his time with my grandfather learning things like how to work on cars and how to build things paint things and that translates over cause my dad does just about everything; he can fix about anything and build just about anything and repair just about anything.
         Um, I guess the only story that they ever say a lot about my grandmother was the fact that she did not like my mom when uh my father and she first got together.
         And uh mostly because my dad, my dad's side of the family were Southern Baptists from the mountains of North Carolina, my mom was a Catholic from California which, oh, just scared everybody right there.
         So, before she even had the opportunity to meet my mom she had already decided that she was this, this evil heathen creature that was going to corrupt her beautiful boy um and even wrote her a nasty letter to that effect.
         Um, she pretty much showed a lot of disinterest at best and, and outright hostility at worst towards my mom until we the kids came along.
         Um, once uh she had grandchildren my grandmother was all smiles to everybody which I think was kind of amusing.
         Um I guess at that point she figured it was too late so she might as well make the best of the situation.
      
      
         Anything else?
      
      
         Um, not that I can really think of off the top of my head.
      
      
         What about when your grandma moved into the house with you, were there any stories about her once she moved into the house?
         Anything you remember?
      
      
         Um, not really anything unusual.
         Um, she uh, at that point, things were, she wasn't in the best of health so there weren't really any, any unusual anecdotes that weren't immediately or at least tangentially related to her health and the decline of her health, so no, no interesting anecdotes about her personality or really, or really anything that I could talk about at that point.
      
      
         OK.
         Well, thank you very much.
      
      
         You're welcome.
      
   

   
   
      
         You're not going to hear yourself on the tape.
      
      
         ( ) OK go ahead.
         OK Adam is now going to talk
         about the music industry.
         Go ahead Adam.
      
      
         The music industry, well, you want more of the juicy, sordid details.
      
      
         Hold on.
         OK go ahead.
      
      
         The music industry.
         I had a dream once of becoming a musician, most specifically, probably a producer slash rapper-writer extraordinaire in the music business and all of my hopes and dreams were shattered once I actually got involved in the music industry.
         Um, specifically, I guess, more the recording aspect and dealing with the people that you have to deal with in the music industry on a day-to-day basis in that supposedly creative environment, and, um, where to begin?
         Let's see I started in the music industry when I was very young, um, as a DJ and--
      
      
         \\How old were you?
         \\
      
      
         \\My mother thought \\ how old was I?
         I was probably 12 or 13 years old.
         My, and I somehow managed to convince my, my mother and stepfather, of the time, to uh get me a couple of turn tables and started mixing songs and scratching and doing all that D.J. stuff.
         And, uh, it was cool and it went on like that for a while.
         And, uh, as I continued, I got more into actually making the music that people would, I guess, rap over and from there I hooked up with a few different people that were rappers, if you will, and, and, uh, kind of developed my own interests in actually writing words and that sort a thing.
         And this is, I guess, after, after high school, kind of right before college, actually, while I was in college, before I went away to school, while I was still in Brooklyn.
         And so I was working with a few people anyway, um, went away to school and got more into it and managed to do a little business deal with a few friends of mine that enabled me to get some equipment to actually produce music on a more professional level.
         And, anyway, uh, anyway, went on from there, started doing a lot of stuff in college working with um one person specifically.
      
      
         
         You can stop it.
      
      
         Anyways where was I from that interruption?
         Was working with somebody in college and, um, a kid by the name of Phil and, uh, you know, we put a few demo tapes together and that kind a thing.
         And he was more active in naturally shopping and, and some, some positive feedback.
         But really what we were, the subject matter and content probably was a bit far into the hip-hop audience.
         Um, it seemed like we were more interested in kind of promoting a level of consciousness, and most other people were interested in talking shit about gang banging, you know, the whole gangster rap thing, and that got really big.
         So NWA and some of the other Dr. Dre, and just some other people that were kind of involved in that.
         So anyway, so we, uh, got some response and, and kind of adjusted things, but after, uh, after a while we kind of went our separate ways.
         I, uh, went off to do my thing and he went off to, to some other things, and, uh, anyway, um, to make a long story fairly short, I got married, and being married gave me a little bit of freedom as far as what I need to do to make money because my wife was working and making enough to support us.
         So I was able to get out into the actual music industry the recording industry and, unfortunately, one aspect of the recording industry, when you get started, a lot of times you have to do either very low-paying or non-paying internships to get into the recording studio.
         Specifically, I mean, if you want to work at, work at one of these places, they, they, uh, generally have a lot of free help, so, uh, you're not going to make a whole lot of money doing this and they expect you to put in a full time schedule so you really can't work another job.
         But at any rate, I had this, this freedom and, um, the girl had come into my life to, to go and pursue this dream, so, um, I started working at place called D&D Studios, which was known for doing, um, a lot of hip hop music, kind of stuff similar to what I was interested in and I was hoping I'd be able to make some, some connections at least, maybe do a little bit of networking there, and, uh, I met some pretty cool people, did some really kind of really interesting projects, um, but--
      
      
         What kinds of people?
      
      
         Well, let's see, people that I've met.
         A, a DJ by the name of Funk Master Flex, who put out a few albums and I don't even remember what they called.
         The Mix, Mix Tape Volume one and two and three to whatever it is now, and a guy by the name of D.J. Premier, who worked with, um, Gangstar, a group called Gangstar, and, uh, another guy named Jerry O'Danagar, who also worked with a guy named Jay-Z, who's pretty popular right now, um, a guy from out west named Exhibit, and, uh, basically a very a kind of a close knit group of people that did this professionally that, that really mostly came from Brooklyn and a few other areas of New York City.
         Anyway, the studio itself was kind a dingy, it wasn't very professional.
         It was really dirty and had a reputation as being such, um, kind of a grungy atmosphere, environment, but where you could do what you wanted to do and get stuff done and what have you.
         From there that was kind of frustrating me a little bit, going into, um, sessions every day or every night and having 15 people around me smoking fat blunts, drinking forties of Old English, and really not getting a whole lot of stuff done that was, it was, it was just depressing.
         And, uh, seeing people with no real creative potential getting paid to do music wasn't very encouraging or inspiring to me.
         So I needed to get out of that environment.
         Um, so I began looking around for other studios that I thought might, uh, have a higher level of professionalism.
         From there I went to a place called Battery Studios, which had everything that, that I was looking for.
         It was, uh, a very established studio and had put out a lot of, um, I guess, well known artists, and it was actually, it was affiliated with Jive Records, um, and Jive Records, I guess, at the time, had, their big act was the Backstreet Boys, and they were recording the Backstreet Boys' first American released album.
         So I got to work on that a little bit, um, and I actually met the whole, the whole other caliber of artists.
         But then, also a lot of the same, that, uh, that deal with the D&D and it was a much cleaner environment.
         They, they definitely had a lot of pride in, in the appearance of the studio and how well it was maintained, which was nice.
         It was nice to at least be working for people who seemed to care about where they were and how things were handled.
         And I met some interesting people there, and, um, D'Angelo was probably one of the most interesting people that I met there and just, just one of the most down to earth artists that I, I have met in the industry.
         Um, also a pothead, but not really so consumed with it necessarily.
         Sort of, it was just kind of how he worked.
         He did things very slowly
         and I don't think that wasn't necessarily the weed that he smoked, I think he just had a style of working and that was how he did it.
         I also worked with The Roots while I was there and their sessions were just hectic.
      
      
         You didn't like them?
      
      
         I liked them, but, yeah, no.
         I like them, but they, I think, which CD does shehave?
      
      
         Um.
      
      
         Things Fall Apart?
      
      
         I don't know.
         Black cover.
      
      
         Black cover?
      
      
         Black cover with white, black and white.
      
      
         Black and white yeah.
         I think I have credit on that CD actually.
      
      
         You do?
      
      
         Yeah on some of the songs yeah.
         If, if it's Things Fall Apart, yeah my name is in the album binding as an assistant engineering credit on the creative cut track.
      
      
         So what did you actually do?
      
      
         I helped people put their music and their vocals to tape.
         Basically, um, the engineer is pretty much the one that, that mans the, the mixing board and adjusts all the volume levels and equalizes the, the different instruments and sounds and separates things and adds effects to it echoes and--
      
      
         So do they actually change the tone of people's voice?
      
      
         They can change the tone of people's voice yes.
      
      
         Do they do it a lot?
      
      
         They don't do it a lot but with, with artists, um, that really can't sing very well that are very big artists that they need to have a perfect sound on the recording, they do.
         There was one particular woman I don't recall her name.
         I think her first name was Patricia, and I don't really recall her last name, but she was a French artist.
         They were comparing her to, the French Mariah Carey is actually what they described her as, and I, I never heard of her before being there, and haven't really heard anything of her since, but I remember they were doing an album of hers and everyday after they would do it they would give a digital tape to a different engineer who would then take it in the back room and correct her voice.
         Basically if she couldn't hit a note he would digitize it so that she did.
      
      
         Um.
      
      
         And they did that a lot with her specifically.
      
      
         Don't they do that a lot with like Britney Spears and people like that?
      
      
         Well with Brittney Spears I think what they probably do is they, um, they've got a lot of back up singers that can sing, and they kind of blend her voice into theirs when she can't quite do it.
         And another, another technique that they kind a use is chorusing, where they will allow you to basically record your vocal the same, the same verse, or the same whatever, the same words, the same lyrics on a few different tracks, and they'll kind a blend it all together so that it, it almost sounds like one very full voice.
         They also have a lot of, uh, effects processors that they can run it through that will add harmonics that will kind of smooth out the voice.
         You know, echoes and stuff like that.
         It just kind a fills it out a little bit makes it a little easier on the ear especially if they can't sing but.
         Well, Battery Studios was great, but it was just, uh, it was just hectic because once if, if they actually liked you and they liked how you worked there and you got along well with the artists and the engineers and stuff like that they would work you to death.
         I had, had put in several weeks that were between 60 and 90 hours a week.
      
      
         Tiring?
      
      
         Yeah, I mean, it was kind a it was rough especially on a young marriage when, when you go into work at six p.m.
         , you know, basically crossing paths on the way out as, as Kim was coming in and get to work stay at work until five a.m.
         come home as Kim was getting up and getting ready for work, go to sleep, she goes to work, I wake up, eat, shower and all that good stuff, and then, uh, she's coming home and I'm going out again.
         After doing that for a couple of weeks it's kind of like, "Damn," you know.
         We didn't get to spend any time with each other and just being married, and, you know, within a year or so or a year or two it was, um, Kim being unfamiliar with, with New York City and not really liking it very much.
         It was kind of, it's sort of, it seemed unfair to me to, um, to subject her to that, and plus, I mean, the schedule was just starting to take a toll on me as well, and you can only put in so many 80 hour weeks before you kind of break down from it.
      
      
         Uh-huh.
      
      
         Plus, I really wasn't making the kind of connections that I wanted to make.
         Unfortunately, um, at least like with managers and producers and, and other, I guess, industry executives or industry people and other people that really could make decisions about things, when they're in the studio working with somebody else that's what they focus on.
         Plus being there and watching how they dealt with other people you kind of pick on people's shadiness and, and bullshit so that they just, I mean you kind of see people for what they are when they don't have their guard up as much and under those kind a those conditions they really don't have their guard up that much they're just kind a relaxing and being themselves and it's kind of scary to see
         what some people are when they're being themselves.
      
      
         Uh-huh.
      
      
         But, uh, I guess I did that for it must have been close to, um, a year and a half maybe, and then I decided not, and ended up leaving.
         I think, uh, Fourth of July was my last day there in 1998, maybe '99, but it was fun while it lasted, you know, it was a lot of cool experiences, got to meet a lot of interesting people, um, got exposed to what I thought I might want to do, it, and decided that I didn't really want to do it, so, I guess, uh, it was a learning experience and one I don't have any regrets about it, but it was a lot of fun and--
      
      
         You can stop.
      
      
         Yeah.
      
      
         Uh-huh.
      
      
         OK good.
      
      
         Thank you.
      
   

   
   
      
         OK.
      
      
         Am I sitting in the right spot?
      
      
         You're fine.
         What stories or books do you remember reading as a child?
         Was there a favorite?
         So that's two questions.
         What stories or books do you remember reading?
      
      
         My favorite books were all about The Boxcar Children.
      
      
         OK.
         Did you have a favorite?
         I mean, of any of those did you have a favorite?
      
      
         No.
         I just couldn't wait to get my hands on the next one that would come out.
         And, and now, today, they have a lot more than they ever had available when I was little.
      
      
         Do you remember a particular color?
         Right now they're all beige--
      
      
         Right.
      
      
         --if I'm not mistaken.
      
      
         Seems to me like a lot of them were yellow.
         It was like a goldish-yellow.
         Not a bright, sunshine yellow, a warm gold looking--
      
      
         What age were you when you started reading those, approximately?
      
      
         Those books?
      
      
         Uh-huh.
      
      
         It would have been the first grade.
      
      
         Did they have any illustrations?
         I don't think they have any illustrations, do they?
      
      
         No.
         Not many at all.
      
      
         All right.
         This might sound like a different kind of question, but is there a certain type of smell that they had to them?
      
      
         Just, um, just an old musty, library-type smell, you know?
      
      
         Hmm.
         OK.
         Was there a particular place for reading that you had when you were a child?
      
      
         I loved to go outside.
         Our neighbors had a big pasture.
         So actually I'd go sit in the pasture and read.
         Sun or freezing, I loved it!
      
      
         All right.
         What stories or books do you remember somebody reading to you?
      
      
         Well, my cousin helped me learn to read before I ever started school, and most of those were just your little, basic, I Can Read books.
         That's what they're called now, I don't, I don't know what they were called then, but the Dick and Jane type books.
      
      
         Yeah.
         See them run.
         
      
      
         Yeah.
         Exactly.
      
      
         All right.
         Did you have a favorite?
      
      
         Let me think
         .
         I can remember her helping me to read the, the books.
         The main ones were like the Emperor with no clothes--
      
      
         
            
         
      
      
         Yeah.
         You know, that type books.
         Absolutely.
      
      
         All right.
         Um, are there any illustrations that you remember from books that other people read to you?
      
      
         
         Um, the one that stands out in my mind are the fables.
         I can remember as a child looking at all the fable pictures.
      
      
         OK.
         Um, all right.
         Is there a particular person that you liked to, I mean, that read to you that you liked to hear?
      
      
         Yes, yes.
         My, um, cousin Roseanne.
         She lived with us at the time.
         She's the one who got me interested in reading.
      
      
         How old was she?
      
      
         She was nine years older than me.
         So
         you know, it was really a good age to--
      
      
         Is there a place that she read to you?
      
      
         We would sit on the living room couch, by the lamp.
      
      
         What stories do you remember family members telling you?
      
      
         Hmm
         .
         There again, a lot of them were the fables
         , mostly stories that had some type of moral or a catch to it, you know?
      
      
         Right.
         Um, were there any associations with events, the stories that they told you, with anything that happened in real life?
         It doesn't have to be like stories from a book, any story.
      
      
         I had an uncle that would tell me like WWII stories and that type of thing, you know.
         And things that they remembered from you, uh, like from the Great Depression or the Holocaust or, you know, even though they weren't directly involved in that.
         That type thing.
      
      
         Um, do you remember any of those?
         I mean, can you remember enough to tell any of it?
         If you can't, it's not a big deal.
      
      
         Well, my mother, she was just a little girl when, during the Depression.
         She told about how, you know, it was so hard for them to get anything.
         They had to grow everything they ate and they had nothing!
         And, of course, her parents weren't one of these that had money in the bank that they actually lost anything anyway.
         But of course when all the surrounding, the stores or whatever, everybody had lost money and so the whole economy was totally poor whether they actually lost money or not.
      
      
         That's, uh, my grandfather talks about that, or used to talk about that.
      
      
         Yeah.
      
      
         They had nothing and, of course, he looks like.
         ( ) All right.
         Um, who is the best storyteller in your family?
      
      
         The best storyteller in my family?
         I would have to say it would have been my Aunt Lizzy, she's deceased now, but--
      
      
         Do you know why?
      
      
         She, I can remember as a child, that in the, it was like she was ageless.
         And it was like she was old, but she was ageless.
         As a child, she never changed.
         And she would like dance a little jig, you know, while she was telling stories.
         She was, oh!
         She was my favorite!
         That's who Sara's named after.
      
      
         Oh, OK.
         What kind of stories, um, did she tell?
      
      
         Just, a lot of times I think she would make up some of them, you know?
      
      
         
            
         
      
      
         Or just really embellish, you know?
         She would definitely add on.
      
      
         
            
         
      
      
         But, uh, and, and there again, most of hers had morals, too.
         Like she would say, "Now what did we learn from that, Debbie," you know?
         And I would say, "Uh...."
         And she would say, "Now that told you that...
         ," and she would go on.
         But she would, if she was talking about rabbits, she would jump around and she's up there and she's put socks on some kind of wires and made little rabbit ears out of them, and, you know?
      
      
         Yes.
      
      
         Just things that my mother would never have done!
      
      
         
         That's funny!
      
      
         Aunt Lizzy would always do it, so--
      
      
         
         So what kind of reaction would she get from you or other people that heard her?
      
      
         
         Belly laughs!
         
         Roll on the floor laughing!
      
      
         Did they ever request for her to re-tell something?
      
      
         Oh yeah!
         Yeah.
         If we had a family reunion or something, a lot of us would get her to re-tell a story.
      
      
         Is there a particular story that you remember her telling?
      
      
         There was one about a rabbit and this, I can't remember all of it, and in fact, we were talking about it at a family reunion not too awfully long ago, and a lot of them were adding bits and pieces to it.
         Because I can just remember her getting up and jumping around and have you heard, uh, it's like a version of the "Little Bunny Foo-foo."
      
      
         Uh huh.
      
      
         That type thing?
      
      
         
         OK.
         What stories do you tell yourself to keep going through hard times?
         Funny, sad, whatever.
      
      
         I guess it's, um, maybe a daily thing, just whatever, depending on whatever your mood is.
         If it's sad, you can always, you could always remember a story where, you know, somebody who has it a lot worse than you do!
         Or if it's happy, it's a, I don't know, it's just recalling memories.
         Yeah, I really like them.
         I can be reading a book and be totally lost in it and think, "Wow!
         I thought I was having a bad day!"
         Or, you know, or you could be reading a really good book and thinking, "I wish my life were that easy," you know?
      
      
         Yes.
         Absolutely so.
         Is there one that, um, you've read lately that's like that you're kind of lost in it?
      
      
         Oh!
         The best books that I've read recently were the, uh, Left Behind series.
      
      
         Yeah.
         Timothy LaHaye and Jenkins?
      
      
         Jenkins
         .
         Yeah.
         Oh!
      
      
         I've only, we've only started the kids version of that, but, um, what, what I've had so far is good.
         It's absolutely a lesson for, you know--
      
      
         Oh absolutely
         .
         I'd like to read the kids version too, just to--
      
      
         Yeah, we need to read it.
         OK, well, I mean, can you sum up one of those books or something that meant something to you in the book?
      
      
         Well, all of them.
         You know, of course, it's talking about being raptured and it's just such a good follower of the Bible.
         I mean it, it follows really closely, and, um, you can't wait till the next one comes out.
         Uh, I think one of my favorite parts is when the two prophets, you know, they had the two?
         You know, Elijah and Moses are at the, the Wailing Wall?
         You know, if you haven't read it, I don't want to tell you about it yet, but oh!
         I mean it's, it's just, it's just wonderful!
      
      
         
            
         
      
      
         You know, it's, it's just like when the Bible says it, says that they will be there and nothing.
         I mean if somebody threatens them or tries to harm them at all, they're immediately consumed in, uh, in uh burst of fire.
      
      
         Uh-huh.
      
      
         Well, you know, and then, of course, the Antichrist is trying to
         trying to say that well, you know, that they have machine guns hidden under their clothing, and, but they're, they're absolutely wearing their tattered, same tattered clothes that they would wear in the Bible.
         And it talks about them having the long scruffy beards, and they've been standing outside for days and days and days and months, and, um
         , you know, without bathing and without doing anything.
      
      
         Oh.
      
      
         And, uh
         , of course, then, like the Bible says, they're put to death again.
         But, I mean, it's, you know
         , God let's them, all of a sudden, one day they have no protection and, and they're killed.
         And then their bodies are put out in the streets and I mean everything is just as an example--
      
      
         Right.
      
      
         But then, you know, they come back to life again and God takes them up to heaven.
      
      
         Yeah, ( ).
      
      
         Yeah.
      
      
         Is there a particular story you like from the Bible?
      
      
         Hmmm
         , I like a lot of them from the Bible.
         Umm, I think one of my favorite ones would have to be, oh goodness.
         I guess one of my favorite ones would have to be, uh, the one about Meshach, Shadrach and Abednego.
         I love that one.
      
      
         Um, could you tell us why?
      
      
         Just the fourth man in the fire, you know!
         
      
      
         It's just cool to think that there's a fourth man in there.
      
      
         Absolutely!
      
      
         OK, well, is there a story that you could tell us like, you know, from your life now?
         Something that isn't, doesn't have to be, you know, relevant.
      
      
         Hmm.
      
      
         I mean my favorite in the jalapeno story, but I don't think we'll put that on tape!
         [They both Laugh]
      
      
         
         Yeah.
         Really!
      
      
         
         For the whole world to know!
      
      
         I don't want them to know about the jalapeno story.
         OK
         , a favorite story.
         Hmmm.
         I'm trying to think
         .
         Oh I've got plenty of stories.
         You know, it's just a matter of thinking about one of them.
         
         Uh
         I can't think of one.
      
      
         
            It'd be easier if we were all sitting around--
      
      
         Oh absolutely.
         If somebody, if somebody brings up a topic, it's like well, "I can do better than that!"
         You know.
         "Let me tell you this!"
      
      
         
            
         
      
      
         Umm, well I could tell you that, you know, my husband is always saying that he thinks I'm a witch because I can say something and then it happens.
         You've probably heard that story before.
         Uh, we hadn't been married long and, and we were driving down the road one day.
         I saw a box in the middle of the road, you know, and I looked over at him and, you know, men always automatically, you can just see them lining up like they're going to hit that, you know?
      
      
         Yep.
         
      
      
         Like it's a point system or something.
         I mean like they'll get some points for it.
      
      
         
            
         
      
      
         And I said, "Don't hit the box."
         And he said, "Why?"
         I said, "Well, if it gets, if it doesn't come out from under the car and it gets under the exhaust pipe and catch on fire."
         And he's like, "Well, that is the dumbest thing I've ever heard in my life!"
         "OK," and I didn't say another word and about two miles down the road, of course, you know, it was `fwapp, fwapp, fwapp,' you know?
      
      
         Yeah.
      
      
         About two miles down the road he pulled over and I said, "What are you doing?"
         He said, "I've got to get out and get that stupid box.
         It's on fire!"
         And it was.
      
      
         
            
         
      
      
         Um, just little things like that.
         So, to this day he'll, about three weeks ago he called me and he said, "You'll never guess what happened to me now."
         And I said, "What?"
         He said, "I's driving down the road."
         And he said, "I saw this bag in the road."
         It wasn't even a box and he said, "I thought, `That's weird!
         ' And he said, "I couldn't, it was like interstate and I couldn't, could not move over either way.
         I knew I was going to run over it."
         And he said, "I thought, `Now just wait and see if it does anything.
         '" And he said, he looked in his mirror and it didn't clear.
         And so he said, just a few minutes later, he could smell something.
         He pulled over and it was hung on his exhaust pipe!
         
         
      
      
         Then.
         Just, just little things like that through the years.
         He, um, we were in CA, and we had been in San Francisco for about three days and this is my first trip to CA.
         And I was just fascinated with the big city: San Francisco life, so many cars and, and the day that we were going the shuttle bus was taking us back to um, the airport: LAX.
         We were going to L.A. Well, we got on the shuttle bus and it just dawned on me, you know.
         And I said, and I told him, "You know, I've been here three days and as many police cars as I've seen," I said, you know, "I've not seen a single accident."
         And he was like, "Oh, don't say that, don't say that.
         You'll jinx us!"
         I was like, you know.
         So we get to the airport.
         We fly to L.A. We rent a car and he decides he wants to take me to Hollywood, drive down Rodeo Dr in Beverly Hills because he's been there before.
         So I'm like, "OK," you know, "I'm all for it!"
         We get in the car.
         We're headed down San Diego Freeway.
         Stop.
         Bap!
         
         And we get hit!
      
      
         
            
         
      
      
         And he's like, you know, without saying, "Oh goodness," you know, "Are you all right?"
         His head whips around and he says, "How's that?
         Is that a good enough accident for you?"
      
      
         
            
         
      
      
         And, of course, it was all my fault because I could have said something about it earlier.
         Of course I was in the, the um, the earthquake, the last earthquake from CA.
      
      
         Oh really?
      
      
         Uh-huh.
      
      
         I didn't know that.
      
      
         Oh you didn't?
      
      
         No.
         I didn't know anything about that.
      
      
         I'm trying to remember what year that was.
         Was Sarah two?
         Was either `94?
         Ridgecrest?
         Not Ridgecrest.
         Ridge, I can't remember the name of that.
         We were in Long Beach when it happened.
         Northridge.
         Northridge.
         Yeah, um, and there again I'm such a sound sleeper that it was 4:30 in the morning and Tony woke me up.
         He was saying, "Debbie, Debbie!
         Wake up!
         Wake up," you know, "It's an earthquake!"
         I'm like, "You would say anything to wake me up," you know?
      
      
         
      
      
         And then I, I realized that he's on his knees and the whole building is shaking.
         And I didn't know it at the time, but we were on the fifteenth story of a sixteen-floor building.
         And I did not know it at the time, but the hotel was built on six-foot rollers.
         I mean it's built to sway and give.
      
      
         Yeah, but still.
      
      
         Yeah, but I mean the, the then that's another reason I know now that everything is bolted to the walls.
      
      
         
            
         
      
      
         Everything, you know?
         Because you'd hear furniture crashing, but I can remember we went straight over to the window and we still had power, but we went straight to the window and it was just, I honestly, I think, thought we were going to die.
         All right, you could see transformers popping everywhere!
         Just looking, that's all you could see were lights.
         It looked like big flashes of light everywhere.
         And, uh, we immediately got on our knees and started praying, buddy, because I knew we were goners!
      
      
         Yeah, I would.
      
      
         Absolutely.
         So--
      
      
         I didn't know you all were in that!
      
      
         Oh, yeah, yeah.
         It didn't really, it didn't really hit me, but later on that day, we were flying to San Francisco.
      
      
         Uh-huh.
      
      
         And it didn't really hit me until we got to the airport.
         Well, our shuttle, the hotel shuttle bus, took us to the airport, and on the way over there, I can remember he stayed on, on his little CB thing the entire time with the dispatcher.
         It was so foggy, or smoggy, probably fog, that early in the morning.
         It was so foggy you couldn't see three feet in front of you, no more that ten.
         And he was like, "I'm heading down to Ventura Blvd," or whatever.
         And she'd say, well, "Don't go past such and such because the, the bridge is out."
         There were reports, and, and after I got home
         I'd see film clips on TV where like a policeman got killed.
         He was going across the bridge and, you know, it was so foggy he didn't know the bridge was out and it was just there, you know, and the entire surrounding area around us was like that.
         There were bridges out, just, and not necessarily just a bridge.
         Just, all of a sudden there would be a sinkhole in the middle of the highway and cars were just going down into it, you know, that didn't know that it was there.
         So if it hadn't been for that guy and that radio, we would never have made it to the airport.
         But when we got to the airport, we were the first flight that they let leave that day and we were sitting in the US Air club lounge.
      
      
         Uh-huh.
      
      
         There's other people coming in and they were waiting on flights, and, you know--.
         We were all sitting there.
         Everybody was reliving their experiences and some talked about what happened to them.
         And they were talking about armoires that were falling across their bed that weren't, you know, bolted--
      
      
         Bolted
      
      
         --bolted down, and, all of the sudden I noticed that everybody, we were just all sitting there just like, like this right here, like we were old people in a room full of rocking chairs, you know?
      
      
         Ooh.
      
      
         And then I realized.
         I mean, that was that was just aftershocks and tremors from the, you know?
         And I thought, "What magnitude of power it would take to move the LAX airport?"
         Here we were all sitting there, you know.
         And for days we felt, we felt aftershocks and tremors.
         It's like a really bad case of vertigo, you know?
      
      
         Yeah.
      
      
         And you just, just sitting there and you just get light-headed and you just think, "Oh it's my equilibrium that's all messed up."
         It was definitely an earthquake.
      
      
         Were the girls with you?
      
      
         No.
         No, they were here with my mother.
         In fact, I had called my mother and it's, it's lucky I called her as soon as I did because later on, the phones were down for hours.
         But I called her and I said, "Now mother, I just wanted to let you know that we're all right," and she was like, "OK--"
      
      
         
            
         
      
      
         "That's good."
         And I thought, you know, "We're three hours behind them out there," you know.
         She had no idea.
         And I was, "We just had an earthquake.
         I want you to know I'm fine."
         And she's like, "Oh my God."
      
      
         "Measured ten on the Richter Scale.
         It's all right."
         
      
      
         Absolutely.
         It's a good thing that I called her when I did, because later on when, if she had heard about it on the news, then she would have been, terribly upset.
         So--
      
      
         Yeah, bet so.
         I'm sure.
      
      
         But, yeah.
      
      
         You remember, um, Hurricane Hugo?
      
      
         Oh yeah!
      
      
         You'd never forget it.
         Were you guys here?
      
      
         Yes, we'd been here since July that year, `89.
      
      
         Welcome present.
      
      
         I was at work when it happened.
         It tore my van all to pieces.
      
      
         Oh really?
      
      
         Yeah.
      
      
         We had to stay in a hotel, a ratty hotel at that, because there was no power, no--.
         The only place that was open in Hickory was, uh, Domino's Pizza.
         That was really scary!
      
      
         We only had power off for like three days here.
      
      
         Right.
      
      
         There were a lot of Duke Power people who lived down here so, I think that kind of helped us a little bit, but, oh, my worse, I kept putting off the laundry, kept putting off the laundry and I said, "I can't take it anymore!"
         Drove it to the laundromat and that day our power came back on
         .
         You know, and, and coffee.
         I couldn't get any coffee!
         I was dying for coffee!
         That's all I wanted was coffee!
      
      
         
            
         
      
      
         But yeah, when Hugo hit, I was at work that day, and I worked third shift at Coca-Cola.
         And, there was only, me and one other girl were the only two people in the whole building.
         Of course, we were in the computer room.
      
      
         Uh-huh.
      
      
         And we had the generator.
         The rest of the building was totally out.
         She was 7 months pregnant.
         Had to go to the restroom every ten minutes.
         Finally, I said, "Look," you know, "we got to scrounge up the flashlight," because, you know, there were no lights in the bathroom, no anything.
         And, and, you know, we had a pretty good walk, too.
         So I told her, I said, "Look, we have the little area where we have all the supplies, that little computer room?"
      
      
         Uh-huh.
      
      
         I said, "Well, go up there.
         You can use the bathroom right there, instead of going," you know.
         And so that's what we did.
         And she said, "What if somebody drives by?"
         I'm like, "Well, you know, who do you expect to drive by in the hurricane?"
      
      
         
         In the storm!
         
      
      
         That's right.
         And I thought, "No security patrol's going to be out here."
         But uh, you know, my and, and, when I got out there to where the little dock was at for the paper, I could see my van.
         I parked right beside this great big tree, and all that while I worried about my van, but not enough to where I was going to go out there and move it.
         You know?
      
      
         No!
      
      
         And the whole time we were in there, all you could hear was
         .
         That's all you can hear!
      
      
         Uh-huh.
      
      
         And so, every little bit, I would go and stick my head out the door and, "The van's OK!"
         Well, of course I worked twelve hour shift three days a week or three nights a week and that, I guess about seven o'clock was when the, the when the next people were supposed to come in.
         It was about 7:30 and here come Richard.
         And that's, I'll never forget it.
         He came and then he said, "Shh, what happened to your van?"
      
      
         
            
         
      
      
         I'm like, "Nice try, Richard but my van is fine.
         I've been going over there all night long."
      
      
         Been checking.
      
      
         He said, "No man, it's just awful!"
         I'm like, "Right."
         Well I went out there and I looked and was like,
         ."
         You know?
      
      
         
            
         
      
      
         The president of the company's room, or, uh, office up on the top floor was on the end, and, I don't know if you know where the Coca-Cola building is in Charlotte, but it's kind of, I don't know, like an oval and arc type shape.
      
      
         Uh-huh.
      
      
         Well, his office was like right here in the middle, like right here on the end, and the windows were blown out!
         All these metal aluminum blinds were wrapped around the wheels of my van!
      
      
         Oh my God!
         
      
      
         A piece of sheet rock, I don't know how large this sheet rock was, but it had blown around the curve of the building, like his office is here and mine was back here.
         It had blown around, slapped the, the driver's window or my side.
         For years, every time I'd put my window down and come back up, you would see little slivers, little pieces of sheet rock on the side of my window.
         I mean it was awful!
         And I had pieces of it, the driver's side door was all dented in.
         And, and little, later on, I didn't know it until later on that, uh, I guess, probably within a year after the hurricane hit, then you could start seeing little spots all over the side of the van.
      
      
         Yeah.
      
      
         That was glass.
         You know where it had just made little things that would--
      
      
         How weird!
      
      
         --that didn't show up immediately.
      
      
         Oh my gosh.
      
      
         Yeah!
         Oh yeah, it was like $1600.00 worth of damage to my van because of Hurricane Hugo.
         And then when uh, I ended up staying at Coke like sixteen hours that day because, you know, the roads were shut down and nobody was coming in.
         Finally, I got to come down Tyvola; the new Tyvola above the Coliseum was pretty new at that time.
         And I, I drove home that way and we'd only been here a couple of months.
         I got all the way out here to the Eagle Rd at that mill?
      
      
         Uh-huh.
      
      
         And there was a huge tree across the street.
         I couldn't make it any farther.
         And I didn't know any back roads.
         I didn't know how to go around and try and find.
         So I just pulled the van over and at the plant parking lot and I got out and started walking and I was just, I can remember live wires being everywhere, crackling and popping.
         And the first thing I saw when I got home, was my neighbor over here, two houses over.
         He was outside, he was, it was really funny.
         He was out and here I come walking up and looking like something the cat drug in.
      
      
         
            
         
      
      
         And he's like, "Debbie, Have you seen my shutters?"
         Every shutter on his house had blown away!
      
      
         
            
         
      
      
         He was like, "All of a sudden we were in KS!"
         And this was Dorothy!
         
         
      
      
         It was like, "No Jerry, I haven't."
      
      
         
            
         
      
      
         But it was it was really scary, the, just the scary, I mean I, I, it's weird, it's like I during the hurricane I really felt safe in that building but, driving home and all the trees that were down.
         It was like I was the only person on the road.
         And when I finally got here, it's like, you know, just seeing everything, and the house!
         One of the first things I noticed was, when I come up from the top of the hill, was my house, it looked like it had ivy growing all over it.
      
      
         Oh really?
      
      
         Leaves from trees everywhere were up against the house.
      
      
         Uh.
         Stuck on the--
      
      
         Yeah, I mean it was just like moss or something grown on everybody's houses overnight.
         
         And all of these houses around here were new.
         And this house right here was just being built and parts of the roof had blown off if it.
      
      
         I'm surprised it didn't damage this over here!
      
      
         I know!
         We were really, really lucky!
      
      
         Yeah.
         You all didn't have a lot of big trees, so that's good.
      
      
         No.
         Uh-huh.
         No.
      
      
         We had, had, um, even our little peach tree, made it through everything.
         Everything that ever, we had a creek in the back of the house and whenever it stormed, small storm or big storm, it just floods, come straight up.
      
      
         "Get under the bed!"
         Mike going to say, "Get under the bed!"
         
      
      
         Right.
         You know, I don't know why she did that.
         I think because we were all pretty fascinated with, um, storms outside of the window.
         We have sliding glass doors in our living room?
      
      
         Right.
      
      
         And we'd sit there and just watch.
         But now I wasn't stupid or nothing when the lights were going `shz, shz,' you know, but she's, "Get under the bed!"
         in her bedroom.
         She's got one of those tall four-poster beds, like that w as going to save us, but we had to get under there a lot when I was growing up, bad storms--
      
      
         Yeah.
      
      
         But, no, Hugo, we had to go to Howard Johnson's or something.
         No the Hickory Motor Inn!
         
         To take a shower!
         
      
      
         I'll tell you what!
         I would have gone just to get a cup of coffee!
         
         
      
      
         That's about three more days of not taking a shower!
         
      
      
         Oh, I know!
      
      
         
            
         
      
      
         Absolutely!
      
      
         That's funny!
         Um.
         I'm trying to think, um, some stories that you told me that, you know, can be aired!
         
      
      
         Without offending any members of the family!
         
      
      
         That's right!
      
      
         Which is the most important thing here!
         I'm trying to think, because you're always telling stories and I just can't, my mind is gone, like your mind is gone on a Saturday.
         
         Did Ida ever tell you any stories?
         Or was she not more--.
         My aunts read to me in my family.
         Not my Mom a whole lot.
      
      
         Well, same here.
         I mean, it's, she would tell me stories about my early childhood.
         Things, you know, stories about my daddy because my daddy died um, before I was three.
         So I didn't hardly--
      
      
         You don't remember anything, do you?
      
      
         And she would tell me a lot of stories about him and, you know--
      
      
         The kind of person that he was?
      
      
         Right.
         Just real stories, you know, things that
         .
         Like the first TV set, you know, when we used to have well water, and the water had to be, you know, got out every afternoon.
         Just, you know--
      
      
         Yeah.
         The hard stuff.
      
      
         --that type of thing.
      
      
         What was your daddy like?
      
      
         Well--
      
      
         That she told you.
      
      
         From stories that, from her and from, uh, other family members, I mean, everybody, they would always say that, that he would always be the first person to help you.
         My mother always said that, that he would help a stranger, you know, get a car out of a ditch or whatever.
      
      
         Uh-huh.
      
      
         And, and it would take her three years to get him to do something for her around the house.
      
      
         
            
         
      
      
         You know, and like she say, "OK Mac," you know, "You need to, we've got a hole in the roof," and she would use that as an example.
         And, "I'll get to it.
         I'll get it fixed."
         And then, you know, get up at three o'clock in the morning because somebody's called because somebody's in a ditch or something.
         You know?
         That type of thing.
      
      
         Uh-huh.
         Uh-huh.
      
      
         And then, basically, everybody's always told me that he was a really big practical joker.
      
      
         Uh-huh.
      
      
         But, uh, actually kind of a mean practical joker!
      
      
         You got some of that then!
         
         
      
      
         Yeah!
         Absolutely!
      
      
         And you help people.
      
      
         Yeah.
         And I would never do anything to hurt anybody or destroy property, you know.
      
      
         
            
         
      
      
         But, um, I mean I wouldn't take a practical joke that far, but there's nothing funnier than a real good practical joke!
      
      
         Yeah.
         Do you have any?
         That you can share?
         
      
      
         Like my daddy, he had five sisters, and one of them was his favorite.
         I mean, they all say, you know, that she was his favorite, and she was telling about when
         it was so hard for her to get to go on a date because everybody was a friend of my daddy.
         Forget his daddy!
         They were afraid of my daddy!
         And one of them said that one day he walked out to the car and they got where they wouldn't come to the house and she had to walk down this long driveway to pick her up.
         And she said my daddy come over there and she said, "He was so nice to my date!"
         And her date stayed in the car.
         And said, she said my daddy was leaning in over the passenger side, like where she was sitting?
      
      
         Uh-huh.
      
      
         And she said, "He just kept talking to us and just telling us what a good movie was playing and all this type thing.
         And he was so nice!"
         She said they didn't realize it until later on that evening that even while he stood there talking to him, he had painted all up and down the side of this guy's car!
         
      
      
         Oh my goodness!
      
      
         That type thing, you know?
         That's--
      
      
         
            
         
      
      
         --That's what I said, I don't destroy property, you know!
      
      
         
            
         
      
      
         And then the sister, she just built a house, and, you know back then, I mean, uh, she had, uh, she was probably one of the first ones in the family that own a brick home, you know?
      
      
         Uh-huh.
      
      
         And her and her husband had built a new house and my daddy did a lot of the carpentry work.
         And the house, once it was built and they got moved in, she told everybody that as soon as they got in the house to take their shoes off, well, from what I gather, it really made my daddy mad because he had helped build it, and, you know.
         So he went and got one of uncle's goats and took the goat back down there with him into the house!
         
      
      
         You know, just things like that!
         I mean--
      
      
         
            
         
      
      
         --I'm not malicious, so--
         
         
      
      
         My daddy, well, he didn't want Sherry and Billy riding in his car, and he made them duck down in front of Billing's Store and when they got there, he'd push them out of the car.
         [They both laugh]
      
      
         Because he was so embarrassed!
         But one time he ran over, they went to ( ) down in Hickory.
         I don't know if you know where that is, but sort of near Longview, actually.
         But they went to this snack bar one time, that's the kind of place where everybody pulled in and they had the speakers?
      
      
         Right.
      
      
         And, uh, he ordered something and then he got out and he was cruising around, acting cool, and everything.
         But he almost killed this guy!
         
         He turned around the curve and this guy was holding the thing like this!
         
      
      
         He was holding, the drink he was holding was going, "shzzzz!"
         Sitting there holding--
         
         
      
      
         See, I love stuff like that!
         I love stuff like that!
         I mean, that's absolutely--
      
      
         Of course, he won't tell us anything, because he won't tell us much of anything about his past because he had a Mohawk and he just--
      
      
         
            Yeah.
      
      
         He's real quiet about the things he had done.
      
      
         Right.
      
      
         I think we don't want to know what he did.
      
      
         That's like you tell your stories to your children and it's like, "Who did you date when you were growing up?"
         "I dated really nice guys.
         You know, very clean-cut."
         Oh my God!
         If they'd seen some of the guys I used to date!
         
         "Oh really!
         They were all scholars!"
      
      
         That's true.
      
      
         Oh!
         Absolutely!
      
      
         ( ) I went with him, but, I mean, you know--.
         But you and Tony aren't very opposite.
         I mean, not really.
      
      
         No, not, I mean, oh, I don't know.
         There's a lot of things we are opposites in, but it all evens out.
         
      
      
         Compliments.
      
      
         Yeah, all compliments each other.
         Like, he hates to read, you know.
      
      
         Mark does, too.
      
      
         And I love to read.
      
      
         Everybody has their own.
      
      
         Absolutely.
         And I'm afraid that all of them are going to be like him in the area.
         I mean, at least it's not, nobody likes to read like I do.
      
      
         Right.
      
      
         You know?
      
      
         Right.
         Does Sarah like to read like you do?
      
      
         Who?
      
      
         Sarah and Andy?
         Do they, they're, are they kind of like Don?
      
      
         They've slowed down.
         They're were doing really good, but--
      
      
         Doing OK in school?
      
      
         Absolutely!
         I think a lot of it is that AR.
         Yeah.
         I'm all for AR, but at the same time, like right now, I had this little thing that kind of upsets me.
         Like right now Sarah has to have two points a week.
      
      
         On the AR?
      
      
         It's hard for her to read at one, it's hard for her to read two, one-point books.
      
      
         Uh-huh.
         Every day it's--
      
      
         Exactly because it has to be done before Friday.
      
      
         Uh-huh.
      
      
         And if she reads a one-point book and takes a test on it, she misses a question, she gets point-nine.
         The reading another one point book, she's going to get, say she gets a 100 on it, she's still only got one-point-nine and she had to have two points.
         So, every week it seems like I have to go to the library and get these little point-five books as, I call them "fillers," just to fill in.
      
      
         Uh-huh.
      
      
         And, and, and I think, to me, I'm afraid that I'm taking away the joy of reading.
      
      
         Exactly.
      
      
         If I said, "You've got to read this now!"
         You know?
      
      
         Exactly.
         Uh-huh.
      
      
         Now Amanda, she gets to read self-selected books and Sarah starting to read self-selected books.
         But, um, I think it's important because not all kids are athletes, not all kids like athletic books.
      
      
         Uh-huh.
      
      
         I probably never read a sports book in my life!
      
      
         I don't think I ever have.
      
      
         As much as I like to read, sports just isn't one of the things that held any interest for me whatsoever.
         I always liked books about true stories, whether it was, it could be murders, you know, those always grabbed my attention, I guess because I knew it really happened.
      
      
         Right.
      
      
         That's just like, historical places.
         I've been to the Alamo.
         I've been to Alcatraz like four times.
         It's like one of my favorite places in the world.
         I'd give anything if I could stay over there.
      
      
         Sean Connery on The Rock?
      
      
         Actually, I was there before Sean Connery.
      
      
         Really?
      
      
         Yeah.
      
      
         It's crying shame!
      
      
         The whole thing, you know!
         I could not get enough information about Alcatraz!
         We got to meet one of the former inmates over there and one of the former guards.
         Yeah, I`ve got a bunch of pictures with him, with a man.
         Actually, I bought one of his books
         , but, um, I mean, it's just fascinating to me, you know!
         To be on "the rock" and just--.
         And the guard was, the inmate was talking about, he said, you know, he said, "They think that it's not, we're not being punished enough.
         Like when we got to go outside to the exercise yard."
         He said, "But if you don't think that it's not punishment.
         He said, "I promise you that I could stand outside in this yard and look across the harbor where you can see the whole bay area," and he said, "If it was quiet enough, you could swear you could hear champagne glasses clinking together."
         Your, I guess your imagination, you know, what all going on there, you know.
      
      
         Uh-huh.
      
      
         But I, oh!
         I just absolutely loved it!
         I mean, I wouldn't want to be incarcerated or anything.
      
      
         
            
         
      
      
         I would love, I would love to be able to stand right over there, you know?
         Just, just to see, oh!
         This is wonderful!
      
      
         Uh-huh.
      
      
         I would have liked to have been there when men were over there, you know?
         Machinegun Kelly and--.
         Oh!
         I would have loved it!
         Love it!
      
      
         When did they close that place?
      
      
         Nineteen, I forget.
         Nineteen sixty something.
         Yeah, um--
      
      
         I mean a whole, is it an island?
      
      
         Absolutely.
      
      
         And the whole thing's a prison?
      
      
         Yeah.
         Absolutely!
         Well, they had warden's houses, all the officers, all the guards; they all lived there.
      
      
         Oh really?
      
      
         Yeah.
         But there's no fresh water.
         I mean every day they had to ferry a boat back and forth and bring fresh water.
         You know, there's, because it's just right there in the middle, you know.
         There's no fresh water and no way of getting fresh water over there, other than by boat.
      
      
         Uh-huh.
      
      
         And so, um, of course everything that's over there, you know how salt water damages, you know?
      
      
         Uh-huh.
      
      
         So everything that's over there is such, just such a hard place to upkeep.
         And it was so cold and each prisoner was assigned a little light, almost like a cardigan type sweater--
      
      
         Yeah.
      
      
         --and a blanket.
         And that's what they had year `round.
         Of course, it's not supposed to be like, you know, Holiday Inn or anything.
      
      
         Yeah.
         I know.
      
      
         There are a lot of bad things about it, its location.
      
      
         That's wild.
         How far is it off the--
      
      
         It's like right.
         Here's the Golden, you can stand right there and like pier, you get under the Fisherman's Wharf and the pier's right there in San Francisco, you can see Golden Gate Bridge, Alcatraz, there's Oakland Bridge--
      
      
         Uh-huh.
      
      
         --and it's just all right there together.
      
      
         Cool.
      
      
         If I had the, it's probably a 15 minute ferry ride.
         But, I mean, that's just a little ferry.
         If I was on a motorboat, it would probably not take me five minutes to get over there.
      
      
         Uh-huh.
      
      
         You know, I mean, it's, you can see it, it's just right there.
         It's beautiful and that's why it's called The Rock; it literally looks like a big rock just popped out of the ocean and just, you know, water all the way around it.
      
      
         I mean, I'd like to go sometime, but it's not on my "Great To-Do list" or anything.
      
      
         It's wonderful!
         Absolutely wonderful!
      
      
         I mean I'd like to go to CA and see the redwoods.
         That's really what I want to see.
      
      
         Yeah.
      
      
         Have you been to see the redwoods?
      
      
         Uh-huh.
         We went to Big Bear Lake and we stayed at a friend's house in, um, Alberta?
         It's a little town, Albert?
         It was a little bitty town, but it's ski country and, um, they'd just finished filming a movie.
         And we were right beside the city called Columbia.
         Where, um, Back to the Future II had been filmed.
      
      
         Uh-huh.
      
      
         We went panning for gold and went horseback riding down there and, um, um, but when we went to see the trees, the trees, there was one tree.
         I have pictures of this too.
         You just have to see it to believe it.
         I put the kids on it just so you could get an idea of about how large it was.
         But this tree, it's been years, probably about six years or five years, so I don't remember the exact width or anything, but this tree was so large, and it was the first one that they had spotted, so they cut it down and there was--.
         OK, this is how big it was, this tree that when the trunk part, they holed it all out and made a bowling alley out if.
         I think like a four-lane bowling alley!
      
      
         Ooh!
      
      
         A four-lane bowling alley out of this tree!
      
      
         God!
      
      
         And right behind it, the stump or whatever was leveled off and they made a bar room with a dance floor out of this tree!
         I mean, it was so huge!
         It was unreal!
         Things like that, I mean, that stuff fascinates me!
         They had the trees where you could literally drive through the tree.
         The tree was kind of like sculpted out and big enough for you to drive through!
      
      
         How neat!
      
      
         I, I have pictures, like started taking a picture and I make Tony and the girls stand like this, with their arms, you know, and still have tree on both sides of them, on either side of them.
         Just amazing!
         These huge trees!
         And that doesn't begin to tell you how tall they were!
         I just couldn't get over it!
         It's just huge!
         I mean, it's just huge!
      
      
         That's cool.
         Was that your favorite vacation spot?
         CA?
      
      
         My favorite vacation spot?
         That would be San Francisco.
      
      
         Oh really?
      
      
         It's just, I mean I wouldn't want to live there.
         Oh God!
         Just the bustle and the, well, everyday, Tony would be working, normally, when we were there.
         I've taken the girls once.
         The rest of the time it would be like, everywhere.
         I just couldn't wait for him to get up and go to work, wherever he had to go that day.
         I was hitting the Wharf, you know, I mean, just everything from the sights, the sounds, the smells, the everything!
         I just loved it all!
         The cable cars, everything!
         I would stop on the Wharf and get some, um, prawns for lunch or something, you know?
      
      
         That's kind of cool!
      
      
         It was just wonderful!
         I wouldn't want to live there!
         But it was just absolutely wonderful!
         Every time he goes back, he has to go to San Francisco, I always try to go.
         If we have enough points to go, I'll go.
      
      
         I'll have to go.
         Is the temperature really hot or cool?
      
      
         It's pretty, well, cool.
         But most of the time when I've been there, it's been around January and it's not, it doesn't seem like it's as cold as it is here, but it's always foggy and January's pretty rainy, too.
         But it's never so bad that it keeps me from doing anything, you know?
         I mean, I can still walk all over the city and I never remember having to walk with an umbrella.
         So, but, pretty often the day is kind of cloudy and just--
      
      
         And you can shop a lot?
      
      
         Yeah.
         Yeah and there's, you know, in CA, it's unlike it is here, they've got bread stores.
         You know, you go buy a loaf of bread, it's like a loaf of bread stuck in one of the old paper popcorn holders, you know.
      
      
         Yeah.
      
      
         I mean it's not cellophane with a twist-tie, "There you go!"
         You know?
         It's like a loaf of bread that you can chew on while you're walking down the street.
      
      
         Yeah.
      
      
         So and, and, the things that, that are everywhere over there.
         You can literally just walk down the street, you can get you a bowl of clam chowder in the scooped out bread, you know?
      
      
         Oh yeah.
      
      
         And I mean, just, just things that you don't get here, you know?
      
      
         We have a hot dog shop where they actually do that, put soup in the bread, but it's expensive.
      
      
         Oh yeah!
         Absolutely!
         I think that, uh, where were we?
         Oh!
         Disney World!
         They have it there, too.
         I was trying to think, the only other place I've seen it was Carowinds, but no, it was Disney World.
         But yeah, I mean, just everything about it was so complex.
         And then you had the people all over the street, not just begging for money.
         It's not like they're just standing there asking for handouts like they do here.
      
      
         Uh-huh.
         Uh-huh.
      
      
         These people are doing something for the money.
         And they take turns.
         Where the, I think it's Market and Powel Streets?
         Market, Hyde or Powel.
         Those three streets all intersect somewhere where the cable cars are running.
         And where they all come down and turn around, it's like these people all have scheduled show times, you know?
         Like at one o'clock, you have this Black guy down there, they're playing a fiddle, and he'll play for 15 minutes, it's time for the next cable car to come in and turn around, and everybody's just gathered around there.
         He passes his little hat around or his fiddle case or whatever and everybody throws money in it.
         Well, then next time, it's a juggler, and the next time it's a mime, and the next time it's three guys who play guitars.
      
      
         Um-hum.
      
      
         But it's always something going on.
         And, you know, it's just the culture and I'm always thinking, you know, it's not, at least they're not expecting, they are providing you some type of entertainment; they're doing something, you know.
      
      
         Uh-huh.
      
      
         And uh, that's the type thing that you really--
      
      
         That's neat.
      
      
         Yeah, just, it's just really nice to see all those things going on.
         I can remember this guy standing there and he had this little dog.
         I don't know what kind of dog it was, but it couldn't have been more than a foot tall standing on his little hind legs, and he also had a little hat and sunglasses and you could have your picture made with him for a dollar.
         
      
      
         Just things like that.
         Things that you do not see every day!
         It's almost like going to Carowinds or someplace and seeing all these little, special little things, you know.
         But they're all over the place.
         All you have to do is open your eyes and you're there!
         You have vendors that, you know, are selling homemade jewelry and there's still a lot of the old hippies, and you'd see a lot of the old hippies, too.
         There's a lot of the areas like that in CA.
         That's my favorite!
         CA would have to be my favorite vacation spot!
      
      
         Sounds like the place to go!
         
      
      
         You got to go!
      
      
         I want to go to CO for the Grand Canyon and all that.
      
      
         Yeah.
      
      
         See all that.
      
      
         Yeah.
         I'd like to do that, too.
         I haven't done that yet.
         There's a lot, in fact, telling about San Francisco is my favorite spot, that's my problem, see.
         I get to travel so infrequently that when I do get to go, I'm always thinking, "Well maybe, I'd love to go do this and this and this."
         And I think, "Well, what if I go and I don't have as much fun as I would if I had gone to," you know?
      
      
         Uh-huh.
      
      
         So, I know if I go here, I'll have fun if I go here!
         So I'll go back there, you know?
      
      
         That's what I tell Mark.
         I want to go back to Chicago.
         I wouldn't live there.
      
      
         Right.
      
      
         But, it is so awesome!
      
      
         That's another place I'd like to go.
      
      
         I mean, it is so busy but if you want to be alone, you can be alone.
         In one of the busiest cities in the world!
      
      
         Absolutely!
      
      
         And nobody cares!
         And then you could walk down Navy Pier and it must be a little bit like San Francisco only they don't have, well, they do have people down there making money, but they're mostly drawing people and stuff like that.
         It is beyond cool!
         And nobody but, you know, people say they're indifferent or whatever, but not really, it's just that it's a whole different
         lifestyle!
      
      
         Exactly!
         Absolutely.
      
      
         They don't, I don't, their driving is,
         my driving, I don't know, but,
         I was getting screamed at and everything else, but, it's just a different place.
         Now I like Schaumburg, it's a suburb, and there's not, you know, it would be like being here, you know.
         Or like Gastonia with Franklin Blvd, stuff like that.
         You had everything you needed.
         You didn't have to go into the city.
      
      
         Right.
      
      
         You could go into the city for something special, you know, that was just there, but everyday living, you could just stay in Schaumburg and never to leave.
      
      
         That's one thing I liked about San Francisco.
         When we stayed right there, right in the heart of it, I could walk anywhere I wanted to go.
         And we weren't, I could literally walk out of my hotel and then two blocks to Fisherman's Wharf and all the piers, Pier 39 is my favorite, it had hundreds of shops on it and you know, and, and, these seals, and nobody knows why.
         And I mean hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of seals just started coming to this pier.
         And they've got all the little boat slips, well, they're just covered with seals all the time!
         And nobody knows why, they just started coming up there, you know.
         But it's just wonderful!
         There's, there's so many things that you never get the chance to see anywhere else, but you can see it all just walking around.
         And then, of course, you have Lombard St, the crookedest street in the world.
         I've walked down that street and it's amazing, you know!
      
      
         Just like those movie spots.
      
      
         Absolutely the crookedest street in the world, yeah.
         And all those are right there within walking distance.
         Then you take a cable car and go to Chinatown.
      
      
         Uh-huh.
      
      
         And still that's not that far, but after walking up and down those hills!
         You are ready for bed when you go to bed that night!
      
      
         
            
         
      
      
         But it is absolutely wonderful!
         There's shops, there's um, all kinds of like comedy clubs and stuff.
         Um, it's just a whole different world.
         I mean, everything that you can imagine seeing all at once, it's just--.
         And you can smell, you have to love seafood, you can smell seafood all over the city and hot breads and go get you a bowl of chapino and a big old thing of bread and just--
      
      
         What's chapino?
      
      
         It's like a fisherman's stew.
      
      
         Uh-huh.
      
      
         We make it here.
         In fact, I bought, I got the recipe from the little, where we went to eat at Fisherman's Wharf.
         At the Grotto.
      
      
         Uh-huh.
      
      
         Got the recipe for chapino.
         It's got like a tomato-based soup, and then it's got uh, oysters, it's got, um, crab claws, it's got shrimp, but nothing's peeled!
         So you have to have these big bibs on.
         It's not something you'd want to eat on a date, you know?
      
      
         
            
         
      
      
         Because it makes such a mess!
         But when we make it here at home, but, of course, we peel everything.
      
      
         Thank God!
      
      
         When we make it at home, we put like the whitefish in it, and like, uh, uh, tilapia.
         Um, oysters and shrimp, you know.
         I don't know if I put any crab in it.
         But it's just wonderful!
         Wonderful!
      
      
         I think my favorite, um, food story from here is
         Tony putting
         pork rinds on the chicken!
         
      
      
         Oh God!
         Absolutely!
         Atkins Diet!
         Yeah!
         Just crush up those pork rinds and roll your chicken in it!
      
      
         It's much more creative really!
      
      
         Yep!
      
      
         That's when you get real desperate.
         
      
      
         Tony, again, somebody was asking me from church the other day, he recently went to the men's breakfast, the one they have once a month on Saturday mornings?
         And, um, Tony came back and said that, he said, "I had to fix gravy for them."
         And I'm like, "Uh oh!"
         He said, "What?"
         I said, "I didn't know you knew how to cook!"
         "But they've been asking me for a long time."
         And basically that's right, they have.
         But I told them, I said, "Tony is one of those people who could improvise."
         So I have learned after 19 years of marriage, I have learned, "If you don't want to know, don't ask."
      
      
         Don't ask!
      
      
         Because he won't lie to you.
         He will not lie to you.
         If he tells you something, it's the truth!
      
      
         
            
         
      
      
         I promise you, he will not lie to you!
         Like, for instance, one day there was a little gravy story.
         He had made gravy.
         As I sat down to eat it, I thought, "We don't have any milk!"
         And Tony likes powdered milk, he grew up on that welfare-type milk.
      
      
         Uh-huh.
         
      
      
         Yuck!
      
      
         
            
         
      
      
         But anyway, with a clothespin on my nose, I was sitting there thinking, and it was white gravy, it was not water gravy.
      
      
         
            
         
      
      
         And I said, "Tony?
         How did you make gravy?"
         No answer.
         So then I got to thinking, "We don't have any powdered milk--."
         "Yes we do!"
         I said, "Tony, look me straight in my eyes and tell me you did not put baby formula in this gravy!"
         And he looked at me and said, "How's it taste?"
         I knew I was eating baby formula gravy!
         
      
      
         
         Eeeww!
      
      
         So you know, hey!
         If I hadn't have known, I would have been fine, but knowing, it's like, "Ooh!"
      
      
         
            
         
      
      
         I was glad I had quit nursing or he would have had breast milk in there!
         
      
      
         There's some things you don't want to know!
         
      
      
         Absolutely!
         I mean it's just like, like...I've learned, if you don't want to know don't ask him!
         Because he can, he can come up with stuff you wouldn't ever think about, you know?
      
      
         Was it OK?
      
      
         Yeah!
         I mean it tasted fine, but it was just knowing that it was in there.
      
      
         
            
         
      
      
         Eating Enfamil gravy, you know?
      
      
         That's hilarious!
         That's nasty, too!
      
      
         Absolute ly!
         Uh-huh!
         Whew!
      
      
         Well, Mark's told me about some of his creative stuff, but Mark's pretty creative, too.
      
      
         Yeah.
      
      
         Like the time he cooked, he left the--
      
      
         Red vinegar?
      
      
         Oh please!
         Well, Mark says stuff about it too and I'm like ( ) and I'm, "No we can't!"
      
      
         
            
         
      
      
         "Forget it!"
         
         But, no, he um, one time put, he said, "I'm going to marinate these salmon steaks."
         Neither one of us had had it in our whole married life.
         "Uh-huh, that would be nice."
         He's going to marinate it and cook it later, you know.
         And it ended up--, and oh God!
         It had the worst ( ).
         It was pretty--.
         I said, "What did you put in this?"
         "Red vinegar."
         Red vinegar and it ruined it.
         It had, oh God!
         It was awful!
         "I'm not going to do that again!"
         On salmon steak, I know.
      
      
         
            
         
      
      
         It was nasty, man!
         I don't think you put vinegar on fish.
         I don't really know.
      
      
         I don't think, no.
         HC: Vinegar's too strong for fish.
         It'll go right through it.
         With oil and stuff, maybe a little vinegar.
      
      
         We'll have to make a big pot of chapino and bring it out there.
      
      
         Oh golly!
         I'd love to!
      
      
         The only time we did it was when Bubba lived here, because it's really expensive and we'll all go in together and make the ingredients.
         But uh, it's, and we even made our own little, one day we all, we always made, you know, I got the bread machine and we always make a big loaf of bread.
         Use it to dip in there.
         Well, bread's fine, I said, "You know," I said, "I would love to have some pasta!"
         So from that time on, every time we'd fix it, me and Bubba would fix a big pot of angel hair pasta.
      
      
         Um-hum.
      
      
         It's real thin.
         Pour that chapino over it!
         Man, it was delicious!
         I mean it's, you use olive oil.
         It's got garlic and um, I'm trying to remember what kind of peppers are in it, but it is so good!
         And you have to, uh, braise the little onions and stuff, you know.
         It's, it's to die for!
         It's awesome!
         Awesome!
      
      
         Cool!
         Yeah.
         I've never had oysters, but--
      
      
         Even my kids will eat it!
         Isn't that something, too?
         I mean, once you get to dipping out, you, you don't have to get an oyster, you know?
      
      
         Yeah.
         I don't want no oyster in it!
         
      
      
         Amanda grew up eating oysters.
         One time she was sitting in the highchair, she'd say, "That's no chicken!"
         And then an oyster I bought her at the Fish Camp, and she'd, she'd bit into it and the centers are normally gray, you know?
      
      
         Yeah.
      
      
         She'd bite it and, "OK, just keep it."
         You know?
         Didn't faze her in the least!
      
      
         
            
         
      
      
         Nate's eating, um, real food now.
         He had um, well actually, we tried those Gerber ones that have the whole peas and stuff like that, a little piece of chicken in the bottom.
         And um, he, he actually ate, like he'll eat baby food fruit or sometimes baby food cereal, not, you know, not all the time.
         He eats fruit at the daycare.
      
      
         You better watch it!
         I told Tony, I said, you know, "Let me think about it."
         Once you've tried table food, can you imagine sucking on one of them bottles, you know?
      
      
         I know.
         It won't bother me because he drinks too many bottles right now.
      
      
         Well, Jasmine's down to about three bottles a day.
      
      
         Really?
      
      
         Yeah, um, when we kept her, I gave her, she had one about, about, well, it's always nap time like 10:30 in the morning around 10:00, one around 2:00 or 3:00 and then one at nighttime.
      
      
         Well, of course, Nate has to have about six or seven or eight.
         And it's getting old by about, I bet we spend $180.00 if not more dollars a month on formula.
      
      
         God!
      
      
         Because he, he...you know I am and he's a bottle freak!
         And I don't know, but I can't afford that much longer and I figure, well he seems--
      
      
         Yeah, well, he's 10 months old.
      
      
         It's almost time to, to--
      
      
         Well, I, from the day, I mean from the day that mine turned a year old, I started buying whole milk.
      
      
         Uh-huh.
      
      
         Absolutely!
         Because even, and Tony said she's complaining the other day she's saying, you know, between Jasmine and Darnell, she said, "I buy...
         ' they drink at least one gallon of milk a day.
         It's like normally they'll drink a whole gallon and start on the second every day, so...you're looking at, at least eight or nine gallons a week.
         So, but, even at that at three dollars a gallon, you know?
      
      
         Uh-huh.
      
      
         What is that?
         $27.00 a week?
         Something like that.
         If it was nine gallons
      
      
         I must spend about $50.00 a week, usually.
      
      
         So you're still saving some, but--
      
      
         Well, I'm ready for it, but now he's decided he'd eat the real food.
         And then, last night, my brother had this surgery and we went over there and Mark said, "Well I guess we'll take chicken because that's the fastest thing."
         So he went in KFC and got one of those buckets with the slaw and everything.
         And um, I shredded up little pieces of chicken and mashed potatoes and goes through these phases where he never eats and you know he never eats.
      
      
         Yeah.
      
      
         But he ate that up and Mark said today, "He acts like he's a little constipated."
         And I said, "Well when you get in there, try and get me some fruit," because when Colleen started eating real slow, when she got hooked in cheese that was it.
      
   

   
   
      
         One two three testing, testing.
         I am Renee Cheezem and I'm doing an interview with Burt Cheezem on March 12th um how old are you, Burt?
      
      
         47.
      
      
         In what country were you born?
      
      
         United States of America.
      
      
         In which part of the country?
      
      
         Georgetown, SC.
      
      
         And grew up, where?
      
      
         In SC.
      
      
         And NC as well?
      
      
         Yes, NC.
      
      
         And Burt, you understand from the form that you signed that this um interview is part of a research project on storytelling and I wonder what your earliest memories of stories being told to you as a child might be.
      
      
         Those would be stories of parents and grandparents, experiences they had in the depression wars and things like that.
      
      
         Can you remember the first story that you can remember anyone telling you some of the first memories of someone telling you a story?
      
      
         Well, it would probably been things like living back in the hills of TN and having to ride a mule to school,
         things like that.
      
      
         Who would have been telling you those stories?
      
      
         This would have been my father.
      
      
         Were there other people who told you stories when you were very young grandparents perhaps?
      
      
         Grandparents grandfathers told me things about
         things he did when he was younger and a construction carpenter and places things he'd been things he'd build.
      
      
         Do you remember anyone in your family telling you stories that were just maybe made up stories or funny stories?
      
      
         Well, I don't think that too many of them were made up some of them seemed kind of funny at the time.
      
      
         Do you remember any specific ones that you could retell?
      
      
         
         Well I remember tales about some of our relations.
         For example, my uncle in FL who uh had his own airplane and decided
         one thing he always wanted to do was land his airplane on the highway so he arranged one day to coincidentally run out of gas nowhere near an airport so he could have the experience of landing his plane on the highway and taxiing up to a gas station to fill it up and take off again.
         At least that's what everyone accused him of doing.
      
      
         So you're not sure if this was a true story or a made up story within your family.
      
      
         I know it's true that he landed on the highway we had the newspaper clippings to prove it.
      
      
         //But the gas station part// you're not sure about.
      
      
         // The gas station part.
         //
      
      
         Yeah, he taxied to a gas station to fill it up.
      
      
         And who told you that story?
      
      
         Uh my father.
         He also showed me the newspaper clipping.
      
      
         Do you remember being read to when you were little?
      
      
         \\Oh yes.
         \\
      
      
         \\Reading stories to you?
         \\ Can you remember the very first stories that were
         read when you were little?
      
      
         Probably one of the first ones that was ever read to me the first one I can remember is my cousins Mary and Glenda reading Trumpet the Dog.
      
      
         It's one of the Little Golden?
      
      
         Yes, I remember all the things about Trumpet the Dog.
      
      
         Can you retell the story?
         Can you remember all the details of the story basically?
      
      
         Pretty much.
         There was Trumpet the dog and he was always raising false alarms.
         And one day the fox got in the hen house and he went running barking and nobody wanted to believe it was him and he finally drug him out there and lo and behold there it was.
         Something to that effect.
      
      
         So this story was read to you by your cousins?
      
      
         Mostly.
      
      
         How old would you say you were when your cousins were doing this reading?
      
      
         Well, I was about
         three at the time.
         They were let's see Mary was probably seven or eight Glenda was about 10 or 11.
      
      
         So your younger cousin was just a beginning reader herself reading stories to you?
         And you remember that one because it was read often or it was your favorite?
      
      
         Yeah, it was one of the ones we read pretty often, it was also the first one I learned to read.
      
      
         Did your parents read stories to you also?
      
      
         Some.
      
      
         Did you have any family storytelling rituals, a story at bedtime reading a Bible story or any of those sorts of things?
      
      
         Uh, not real continuous or anything.
      
      
         Who in your family would have been most likely to read, to read this you a story or tell you a story?
      
      
         Probably depended on which night it was.
         Probably more likely my mother than anyone else.
      
      
         Did you have lots of storybooks
         at your house that were read to you?
         BC: We always had books lots of books.
      
      
         You said that you remembered the story of Trumpet the Dog and your cousins reading to you.
         Uh, did that go on for a long time until you were able to begin reading stories on your own?
      
      
         I spent a lot of time at my cousin's house from about the time I was about three probably I was about eight or nine.
      
      
         Even after you said that you learned to read the story of Trumpet the Dog, after you began to read on your own did sometimes your cousins or other people still read or tell stories to you even though you could read?
      
      
         Yes.
      
      
         What was, well you clearly remember this story, but once you got a little older and could remember a little better, what would you say some of your favorite stories and books were, as a child growing up?
      
      
         How old are you talking about?
      
      
         Oh, elementary school age.
      
      
         Well, probably the favorite book I had, this is a little different
         I had The Giant Golden Book of Astronomy, which I got when I was in the second grade and I read it cover to cover till I wore it out.
      
      
         Yeah and why was that particular one special?
      
      
         Well, because it was really interesting stuff.
         It was about the same time when all the space program was getting started off and I was in the first grade when the United States launched the first satellite and I was in the second grade when the first manned space capsule was sent up and because of what was going on at the time it was real interesting.
         The book just tied right into it.
      
      
         So that one you really enjoyed and you read over and over again?
         What about um what about and it was of course it sounds like a true book a scientific book about stars and space.
         What about fictional stories?
         Do you remember storybooks or children's novels that you read growing up or you like?
      
      
         My grandfather had a real interesting history books.
         They were sort of semi-factual fiction history people in the history of the country, like stories of George Washington growing up, some of the explorers of the West, Lewis and Clark, Fremont Carson, people like that.
         ()
      
      
         So you really liked historical and non-fiction kinds of things?
         But I also know that you like fantasy as well?
      
      
         Science fiction.
         I didn't get started on that till I was in about the sixth grade.
      
      
         And you learned to read quite young, didn't you?
      
      
         I was four years old at the time.
      
      
         If I remember correctly the stories that your mother has told me, you pretty quickly progressed to reading serious you moved pretty quickly from Trumpet the Dog to more heavyweight reading materials didn't you?
      
      
         Yeah, I guess so.
      
      
         Um, do you um, do you remember any particular books or stories that you feel like had an impact on you as you grew into adulthood stories that maybe the message of the book or story has had a real impact on your life?
      
      
         I'd say quite a few.
         
            Well, let's see,
         there's I guess one of the favorite author's of mine is Isaac Asimov who wrote some of the best science and science fiction that was ever written.
         A lot of his books aren't really fiction but scientific essays that he prepared for publication.
         I guess one of the other authors I like a lot uh is C.S. Lewis.
         I've read several of his books both fiction and non-fiction books.
      
      
         Do you think that um reading these books when you were a teenage and older elementary school student had some impact in your career decisions, to study mathematics and more technical subjects?
      
      
         It's kind of a, "which is the cause and which is the effect," question.
         Asimov, his writing is very good sound factual.
         It's also very interesting easy to follow for that type of writing.
         I read a lot of other authors that weren't, weren't as good writers but also had interesting ideas.
         I think the best combination of interesting ideas and interesting writing.
      
      
         When you think back to when you were younger and people were telling stories to you and reading stories to you, um, it sounds like the time you spent with your cousins and with your family when all this was happening is a time in your life that you remember real fondly?
      
      
         Yes.
      
      
         Do you think that reading and storytelling is a big part of that?
      
      
         I would say so.
      
      
         Now that, that you're an adult obviously and have had children of your own what stories do you remember telling to your own children, and reading to your own children?
      
      
         Well, let's see.
         I've read The Cat in the Hat about 475 times.
         All The Little Monster Books, I can't remember what the individual names of them were but I've read them all multiple times.
         RC: Do you remember telling them not only reading to them but telling them stories as well some of the stories that were perhaps told to you that maybe you been passed down to them.
      
      
         Oh yes.
         All the family heritage stories about how hard life was for my parents.
      
      
         And your own stories?
      
      
         Yeah, how my own stories about hard my life was (laugh) and all those sorts of things.
      
      
         Do you um, what kinds of things do you read now other than some authors that you like mentioned.
         Real currently, what do you enjoy reading at the present?
         What writers?
      
      
         Let's see, recent authors You've probably never heard of any of these, but Gregory Benford is very good, these are science fiction, uh, see David Grant, science fiction that is real good.
         Uh Asimov, he died about 8 years ago but I still find one or two of his that I hadn't read yet.
         
      
      
         We were mentioning, we were mentioning writers you enjoy reading now and we had to take a break.
      
      
         Let's see, the others that I could think of that I read recently, there were some Civil War books written by Jeffrey Shaara and the other by his son Michael.
         Very good.
         Another book that I read recently is very interesting books The Journals of Lewis and Clark.
      
      
         Which is really a story from beginning to end, I suppose.
      
      
         It is a narrative of the three year long trip they took from Washington, DC all the way out to the Pacific Ocean and back.
      
      
         Now, a lot of people would probably look at that and think my goodness I'm not sure I'd want to read all those details () trip.
         What did you enjoy about reading the Lewis and Clark journals?
      
      
         Well this was this was the first time that anyone had ever traveled here and recorded any of their experiences and they saw the entire western half of the continent for the first time.
         No one else been there no one else had ever experienced or written about what they'd seen and brought it back.
         50 years later most of what they say and experienced didn't exist anymore.
      
      
         So in some ways it was very similar to the space exploration that you were so interested in?
      
      
         Kind of.
         It was something
         that they were in a position to do one time and no one before or no one since could ever reduplicate it.
      
      
         Some people think that storytelling in our culture is, is uh vanishing, because of television and computerized games and email and so many other things that keep people from sharing stories and taking the time to read.
         Do you think that story telling continues to be important and why?
      
      
         I think it's important because it's the real link you have to your past and heritage and it's also declining for the same reasons you mentioned.
         People just don't have the time or take the time to keep the traditions going
         they just get too busy or too lazy.
      
      
         How do you try to counter that with your own children and will continue to try and counter that as grandchildren are added to your family?
      
      
         As I have opportunities, as situations arise in the family such as motorcycle purchasing and things like that.
         I try to weave some personal experience into the conversation.
      
      
         Motorcycle purchases?
      
      
         Oh yes!
      
      
         And storytelling applies?
      
      
         Certainly.
         I have some motorcycle stories going back two to three generations actually.
      
      
         And now that I know your own son is considering purchasing a motorcycle those stories hopefully can help him make // a wise decision //.
      
      
         // A wise decision// yeah.
         I suppose.
      
      
         Well thank you for taking the time to participate in this interview and for you helping with the research project at UNCC.
      
   

   
   
      
         I am Meredith Combs and it is March 8, 2000 and I am interviewing my mother, Jane Combs
         .
         Um, what can you tell me about the stories that you first remember being told as a child?
      
      
         Um.
         The stories I remember being told, the most, came out of the Little Golden Books.
         It was a series of little fiction stories, and my mother must have read me every single one of them.
         Um, do you want names of them?
      
      
         Sure.
      
      
         Well, there were names like The Pokey Little Puppy, um, Mr. Bear Squash You All Flat, um, just, they were just little stories about animals and they had Big Golden Books and Little Golden Books and my mother, I know she bought me every one of them and read them to me.
      
      
         Did your dad read to you too?
      
      
         Sometimes, but I remember my mother reading to me the most.
         I had aunts and my grandmother, one of my grandmothers read to me too.
      
      
         Um, how old do you remember being--
      
      
         Um, well I know it was before I was five, probably, I know at least four and I'm sure she read to me before that.
      
      
         OK.
         Um, what do you remember any stories they told you, your parents told you?
      
      
         You mean like imaginary, or fictional stories?
         They made up stories sometimes, my mother in particular, she made up stories.
         In fact I think she still does now
         .
         But she made up a lot of stories then, um, sometimes they had us, my sister and me, in the stories, and then sometimes, the just were from I don't know where.
         But she was very imaginative and creative and she made up lots of little stories for us.
      
      
         Did they ever tell you factual stories about the area that you lived in?
      
      
         Oh yes, yes they did.
         They told me lots of family stories about people that I knew, about my grandparents and my great-grandparents, and um, lots of family stories, history, history of the people we knew or heard about.
      
      
         Um-hum.
         So that helped you learn about people that you had not necessarily met.
      
      
         No, hadn't seen some of them.
         Um, beyond my grandparents I hadn't seen any of them, I guess, but they began to take on a personality and something I could kind of see in my imagination.
      
      
         Um-hum.
         Um, what kind of things did you remember reading when you started to read?
      
      
         Um, I read some of the same books that they had read to me, first, and then, as I got older, I just got hungry for books.
         I read, my parents had a lot of books.
         They had bookshelves, um, that my daddy built, that were built in bookshelves and he um, they were filled up with books, and one summer, I remember when I was a teenager, I just made it a mission to read as many of those books as I could, and I plowed, they were fiction most of them.
         There were some were history books in there, too.
         But I plowed through a bunch of them that summer.
         I just kept reading until I finally had read almost every one of them.
         Lots of them.
      
      
         Do you remember the names of any of them?
      
      
         They were, um, they were best-seller type fiction from the um, 40's and 50's and 60's and on, just, they were members of a book club and they got a lot of books that way.
         And whatever they got, I read.
      
      
         Um, well, let's see, so do you think that those experiences helped you figure out the kinds of things you liked to read?
         Like what, the stories that they told you and read to you, did--
      
      
         Well, they must have because I still read fiction.
         I still read history.
         I love historical novels.
         I love to read just plain history, um, it must have rubbed off in some aspect because that's the kind of thing I still read.
      
      
         Um, well, do you think it also helped when you became a parent that you naturally wanted to read to your kids?
      
      
         Yeah, I'd always been a reader.
         I'd always been read to, so I think, yes, I mean I did read to my children, to you guys, to you and your brothers.
         What was that?
         
         Oh, that.
         I had to let the dog in.
         Excuse me.
         All right, now what?
         Oh I know what I was going to tell you.
         Um, another thing my mother read to us was poetry and she also had books that had songs in it, children's songs and so not only did she teach us the words to all those things, but we sang them too.
         And, um, she read, I forgot about the nursery rhymes.
         We learned all of those and the fairy tales, the classics, she read all of those to us.
         But the poetry I remember and she taught us, you know, some poetry.
         She remembered poems that she had learned when she was in high school.
         I think she must have enjoyed it because she read them to us too.
      
      
         Original poetry that she--
      
      
         Not really original, no, it was, uh, poems by well-known authors that you'd find in a book, but she had to memorize a lot of them, and she, but she read us children's poems, too, out of books, books that were written for children.
      
      
         I see.
         Well, as a teacher, do you see reading as something that is still important in families today?
      
      
         I think a lot of parents are still reading to their young children.
         I, I do think they read to them when they are little.
         But as they get older, I think children are so involved in other things.
         They're going to lessons for this and that, and sports, and they're playing interactive games with their computer and, uh, watching TV, and I think, really, they're not reading on their own, like maybe we did when I was that age because we didn't have all those other things to do.
         So I think maybe, reading for young people, is not as important.
         They're still a few that you get in the classroom who are avid readers and they just stand out.
         The others, you can see in things like vocabulary and um, just their general knowledge of things, um, they're not reading anymore.
         They don't even watch the news, but they're not reading the newspapers or new magazines or anything.
         You see it, I think you see it in their, in how they do in school.
      
      
         Does it affect their comprehension?
      
      
         I think it probably does, because they're just not reading as much.
         Um, the good students, the ones who do well academically, they're going to do OK anyway, but the ones, um, there are some that would really benefit from continuing their reading, either being read to or reading on their own, for pleasure--
      
      
         Right.
      
      
         I don't think they do that so much anymore.
      
      
         OK, well
         , um, going back to you, do you think, uh, are there any other ways you can see that reading and listening to stories, and literacy, um, being exposed to literacy, has um, affected you in your life?
      
      
         Hmm, well
         , I had some teachers that were really, um, influential about what I read and their love for literature.
         I don't know rather, how much it directly affected the fact that I was an English major in college, but I know that, um, it didn't hurt to like to read when you have that major, um, there were some times, I remember, a fifth grade teacher and a seventh grade teacher who were especially, um, full of the love for reading and literature and they made that come alive for me as a student.
         So, I hope somehow along the way that I've been able to pass that along to my kiddies.
      
      
         Well, I'm sure you probably have.
         Well, um, is there anything else you'd like to add?
      
      
         I can't think of anything, but it's been nice chatting with you.
      
      
         Thank you.
      
   

   
   
      
         OK.
         Um.
         This is a story that my dad told me when I was small, a long time ago that, there was a girl that, she was very young, she was going to go visit her parents.
         And she was like driving on a curve.
         And she was, she was going very, too fast, and she crashed and then she, um,
         she goes there, um, every year she comes out at night and then one time a guy passed through that curve and saw her and he stopped there and picked her up and she told him that if she can, if he can take her home to her parents house.
         And he goes, "Yeah, sure, I'll take you."
         And then he took her, and she told him that was her house right there, so he left her there.
         And two days later, he came and visit her and then he knocked on the door and asked for her, and his, her, his mom, her mom told her, told him that she, she wasn't here, because she was dead for a long time and he goes, "How can it be?"
         But, that he brought her two days later and that's what happened.
         And every year she comes out at night and asks people for rides home because she never get, she never got a chance to go visit her, her parents.
      
      
         Before she died.
         Oh.
      
      
         Before she died and she crashed on that curve.
      
      
         Oh, can you think of any other stories?
      
      
         Not really, that's all.
      
      
         Not really?
         Any stories from your grandpa, aunt, uncle?
      
      
         Na, that's the only one they told me.
      
      
         Is there a favorite story or storybook or anything that you had when you were little that somebody read to you?
      
      
         No, they didn't, no, just that one.
      
      
         OK.
      
      
         Enough?
      
   

   
   
      
         Hi!
         What's your name?
      
      
         My name is Gloria Cotton.
      
      
         And, uh, Gloria, what's your age?
      
      
         I'm 50.
      
      
         OK.
         Um, is the United States your, uh, birth country?
      
      
         Yes, it is.
      
      
         And, uh, I assume, um, that English is your native language.
      
      
         Native and only language!
         
      
      
         OK.
         Um, well, um, we wanted to talk about, um, a favorite story, and, um, do you have a favorite story?
      
      
         A favorite story about anything?
      
      
         About anything.
         It could be a traditional story, like you find in a folk tale, or out of a book.
         Or it could be a family story that gets passed down.
         Um, do you have a, one of those types of stories?
      
      
         Yes, I believe I have.
         It's not a family story.
         It's a story from The Bible.
         Is that OK?
      
      
         That's great!
      
      
         OK.
      
      
         So it's, it's written, as opposed to oral?
      
      
         Yes.
         Yes.
      
      
         OK.
         Uh, who--?
         Did you read this story itself, yourself, when you were young, or was it first told to you by someone?
      
      
         No, it was first told to me by my grandmother, who is, um, was my first teacher, and remains my hero.
         Even though she's no longer physically on the planet.
      
      
         Uh-huh.
         How old were you when she shared this story with you?
      
      
         My first recollection I was three.
      
      
         That's
         that's very young.
         Uh, it's interesting how, uh, stories become so impressionable the younger the hearer.
      
      
         Yes.
      
      
         Uh, well, would you care to relate the story to me now?
      
      
         Sure.
      
      
         OK.
      
      
         Well, this story, and I must tell you, I haven't read this in The Bible, so I don't know if it's totally accurate, but I prefer to get it like this: There was a huge crowd of people, and, um, Jesus decided that what he wanted to do was to, uh, entertain the little children.
         And all the adults were standing around, not really paying much attention to the children, because children, of course, were supposed seen and, uh, not heard, and not really much being seen, actually.
         And Jesus, uh, actually made all the adults move aside, and let the little children come up.
         And he said, "Suffer the little children."
         In other words, you know, it might be painful for you, or inconvenient for you adult people, but, "Let the children come to me, and forbid them not," don't stop them from coming.
         They have a place here too.
         And he sat and talked with these little children, and he hugged them, and loved them all.
         And she told me that everyone has to be like a little child to God, and that God loves everyone just like He is their own father and they are His children, because of what they are.
         And that children actually, the innocence of children, the unconditional love of children, is the way that we, now, that I'm an adult, that adults need to be with each other, and that the greatest lesson in that, when you can be like a little child, then you are doing what's pleasing to God.
      
      
         Uh-huh.
      
      
         And also, and the thing that I resonated with as a kid, was that you always had a special place, and a special protection, and a special love, uh, from Jesus and God, and that was another thing that made me feel special as a little girl.
      
      
         Uh-huh.
         So could you reiterate the message, quote-unquote, um, that you got from the story, from your point of view?
      
      
         The message, again, that I get from the story, for me personally, was that there would always be a special connection between me and God, and actually was just another of the ways my grandmother put for me to learn, or believe, that I could do anything, I could be anything, because I had a special connection and special protection, um, from not only her, which was more important for me at the time.
      
      
         Right.
      
      
         But also from God, and that that would always be there, that the way that she was able to do it was actually by remembering to me to be more child-like, more innocent.
         And that keeps me, as an adult, one, remembering to pray like a child, and to maintain some of the innocence, which is difficult, of a child.
         And I think that brings a smile to God's face.
      
      
         Um, as a child, what did you like most about the story, as opposed to what you would like most about it now?
         Were they the same, or different?
      
      
         No.
         What I liked about it was that kids were special.
         And, you know, with this, you know, it wasn't many opportunities for kids to be special, because kids weren't, you know, you were pushed out of adult conversation, and just really pushed to the side.
      
      
         Uh-huh.
      
      
         Again, that "seen and not heard" kind of thing.
      
      
         Right.
      
      
         And I liked the fact that the adults were made to wait.
         
         
      
      
         Yes.
      
      
         
         And be seen and not heard while the children were give a special place of honor.
         So I liked that.
         Yes.
      
      
         Do you have a chance to re-tell this story, um, in your work or to your own children?
         How have you shared it over the years?
      
      
         Well, you know, it's really interesting that we're talking about this, because my son, who is now 28, I guess I shared it with my children when they were growing up, but not in any particular special way, but my son is in therapy now, and uh, this is one of the visioning exercises that this therapist told him, that he should do whenever he is angry, to imagine that he is one of the little children that Jesus is putting his arms around.
         And so he came home and told me about that and he and I had a discussion about that, and it took me back to the safety and this warm feeling I had when I was a kid.
      
      
         Uh-huh.
      
      
         I think in my work, what I remember to do, and what I write into every single class that I facilitate, OK, no matter what it is, if it's leadership, conflict, no matter what, is what I call a STAR model.
         And it's an acronym for Sensitivity, Trust, Appreciation, and Respect.
      
      
         Uh-huh.
      
      
         And all of that is the same feeling from that story that I had when I was a kid.
         And I try to tell people this is the environment you want to try to tell my students, to encourage them to embrace the kind of environment where it's safe, to agree or disagree, to discuss anything.
         And be more productive when you have this sense of honoring and valuing.
         I don't say words like "Love," and I don't mention Jesus, I don't talk about any deity, um, because that's part of the respect, too.
         I firmly am committed to that.
         That not all people are, and I don't want to put up any walls for them.
      
      
         Uh-huh.
      
      
         So it's more a context that I am interesting in them embracing.
         If they want to say, "Working from the universe," or "Good business sense," or "God."
         I don't care what they call it.
         Um, I let them use whatever words to describe the behaviors that is gonna get you there.
         So it's that same feeling that is created in my workshops, that I had when I was a kid, actually.
      
      
         You, um, tantalized me with the reference to your grandmother, and that she is still your hero.
      
      
         Yes.
      
      
         Could you describe her?
      
      
         Hmm
         Describe her and what she did?
         Why she's my hero?
      
      
         Right.
         What attributes did she have that made you, um, respect her and view her as your hero even to this day?
      
      
         She had the ability to, first of all, she didn't know any strangers.
         And having first met someone she had the ability to quickly make them feel they had been in the family, and not only in the family, but a loved member and close member of the family.
         She would make everyone feel comfortable, respected, and more than that, truly loved
         truly, truly loved everyone.
         And as a little girl being blessed to grow up with her, I lived with her and my grandfather, and my brother and I, lived with them until I was six years old, exclusively.
         My mother was working, and that was fine, the best thing she could have ever done, to take me to my grandparents.
         And she really just instilled in me a sense of centering and acceptance of who I am, a clarity of understanding that I could really do anything that I put my mind to.
         There's nothing that I could not do, if I wanted to do it.
         A sense of strong independence, to the point that I never had, I never had, the problem of worrying about peer pressure.
         When I was in elementary school, high school, or college, never ever did I have that thing with my friends, like smoking, so I had to smoke.
         I didn't, none of that, because I was very much my own individual, and very centered and grounded.
         And I got that from her, truly unconditional love.
         Truly unconditional love.
         She would correct me when I was wrong, very lovingly, but I never ever doubted that she loved me, never.
         Um, and I, to this day, I live my life, um, for the most part, in ways that I'm always seeking her approval, and I think she is my touchstone and my benchmark.
         And I think if Mama would be pleased with this, it is good.
         
         So, you know, I have my standards, and I match my standards to what her standards would have been, I believe.
      
      
         Uh-huh.
         How old were you when she passed?
      
      
         She died in 1982, so what does that make me?
         I was born in 1949--.
         I can't do that math in my head!
         
      
      
         That's OK.
         Well, you've described a wonderful person, and that highly complements the story you told.
         I mean, they're so hand-in-glove, that I sort of see it as one seamless piece that you've shared.
      
      
         Yes.
      
      
         So I really, I really do appreciate it.
         Was there anything that I failed to ask that I should have, relating to this story that you've told, or background to the story that you've told?
      
      
         No, I would want to thank you for asking me those questions though, because it's given me the opportunity to go back to a very precious place, to feel her love really, really present, and, um,
         you know, that makes me smile all over.
      
      
         Well, the magic is that she can be in two places at once, because I feel it too.
      
      
         Oh, great!
         
         Wonderful!
      
      
         That embrace is very special.
         Well, Gloria, thank you very much and I do appreciate everything you've shared.
      
      
         You're welcome.
         Thank you.
      
   

   
   
      
         OK uh, this is a story a little while back when uh, me and uh, two friends in the ninth grade got a wild hare.
         It was uh, me, a guy name Jeff Teague, and Craig Barsley.
         And uh, it was a winter night and it had just begun to snow and uh, in Shelby it don't really snow that much so we were all pretty excited.
         And uh, we were all spending the night at Craig's house and uh, we decided we wanted to sneak out of the house.
         Well, it was about 1:00 in the morning and uh, Craig was scared we were going to wake his parents up or his mom up.
         And uh, you know after a little while we ended up talking him into it and uh, so we all snuck out his window in his bedroom and um, we proceeded to uh, go over to uh,
         a girl's house that we knew named Mary Anne.
         And uh, so we all snuck out of the house and uh, we walked through the snow and it was real cold and we didn't really have any warm clothes on because you know we aren't really used to the snow that much.
         And uh, we had proceeded over to this uh, girl's house and uh, she uh, let us in the house when we get over there and uh, we uh, stayed there and watched a movie with her.
         And uh, you know, I mean we were trying to be quiet not to wake her parents up so you know and uh, we ended up watching this movie and this movie ends up lasting until about um, 4:30, 5:00 in the morning.
         And uh, she's, her dad works uh, construction so uh, she told us we had to leave because her dad gets up real early in the morning so uh, we hurry up and get out of the house and uh, we're walking on the way home and uh, we're seeing the uh, newspaper car running around throwing newspapers out.
         And uh, I don't know who thought of it I don't know if it was me or
         Jeff or Craig but uh, we uh, we had some cigarettes on us and we were smoking trying to be the big rebels you know and we had a lighter.
         And uh, one of us thought of the idea of sticking a newspaper in the mailbox and setting the mailbox and newspaper on fire.
         So uh, one of us we were walking down the road picked up uh, a newspaper wadded it up and stuck it in the mailbox and uh, this was uh, metal mailbox with uh, brick around it.
         And we stuck it in there and we lit it and it shot into a big old flame, you know lit up the whole sky.
         And I mean we were just, you know it got us real fired up you know and so uh, we were walking along a little further and we saw another newspaper and uh, we stuck it in the mailbox and it was another metal mailbox.
         So uh, we were like "Cool!"
         and we lit it up again and uh, this big old flame shot out and we all ran off.
         And uh, as we got closer to Craig's house that we were staying at we came by uh, it was a plastic mailbox, and uh, so we uh, stuffed the newspaper in it and lit it on fire and we, we weren't really thinking and all the sudden the newspaper caught on fire and then the whole mailbox caught on fire.
         It, it was plastic and it started dripping and fireballs of plastic came off.
         And uh, you know we were all fired up.
         We came up to uh, newspaper mailbox that was plastic and we lit that on fire, we actually set a couple of those on fire, and uh, I mean by this time, I mean you could, the sun, you could almost see the sun coming up so we run as fast as we can to get back to Craig's house and we sneak back into the back window and uh, we go to sleep.
         OK, we uh, went to sleep and uh, about an hour and a half later about 8:00 in the morning uh, Craig's mom comes in to wake us up and says there's two guys that want to see us at the front door.
         And uh, so we walked to the foyer area of the front house at the front door and uh, these two old men say uh, ask us uh, what we were doing last night.
         And we were like, "We didn't do anything last night," and Craig's mom asked us, you know, did we sneak out last night and we all said, "No, no."
         We denied it, and uh, the old man said, the old man asked us, you know, "Did you," I mean he said, "Did you or did you not sneak out and burn any mailboxes?"
         And we just denied the whole thing, you know, and uh, finally the old man says, "Well you know I wouldn't have never thought it was y'all but, uh, seeing it was snowing last night and uh, foot tracks go all the way from my mailbox to this house right here uh, I don't have any choice but to believe it was y'all."
         And uh, he said, "Especially the fellow that was wearing these soles that say Vivran on them," and uh, Craig has his boots sitting by the door and looked on the bottom of them and had, uh, the sole had, uh, was written, it said Vivran on the bottom of it.
         And he said, "These soles right here match right up to it."
         And uh, we were just like "Damn," uh, so, uh, we finally confessed to it and, uh, we told him yeah we did, we were out there.
         Found out later that the, uh, one of the old men got up every morning about 5:30 and, uh, walked the, uh, around the neighborhood and he saw us, uh, do it actually.
         And, uh, he just followed our footprints back to the house and waited until earlier the next morning to uh, come to say anything.
         So we thought we were being sneaky, but uh, found out the whole time we were being watched.
         And uh, so after that, uh, the, uh, old man that we burned his mailbox down, uh, told us that, uh, he was going to, he would press charges unless we replaced and fixed his mailbox.
         So uh, that whole day I think we put up two newspaper mailboxes, uh, one complete wood frame and plastic mailbox and that was cemented in the ground.
         And uh, so it was uh, not a very good night for us not a very good day.
         And uh, but one of the cool things that happened was uh, that morning in the paper in the write up columns with police reports and they had a little column, had what we had did that night, and it said they were looking for suspects, but uh, said, but they never followed through on that, the guy never pressed charges or anything like that so uh, we got off easy on that.
      
      
         Do you got another one?
      
      
         Uh--
      
      
         Do you want me to turn it off so you can think?
      
      
         Uh, nah I got it
         uh, another story, uh, when I, uh, this happened uh, senior year over the summer after my graduating senior year.
         Uh
         , I live out on Moss Lake, it is in Shelby, North Carolina, Cherryville actually, uh
         , me and a buddy of mine from way back in elementary school, we were best friends back then, uh, I invited him over to my house and we were going to go out onto the lake.
         I have a jet ski and he's got one too and, uh, so we, we went out there and started drinking a couple of beers.
         And uh,
         we ended up drinking more then going out in the water and, uh, we were out in the water and, uh, we come up and we were going to get another beer off the dock and, uh, he, uh, runs his jet ski up on land, and we had to pull it back and put it in water.
         And we check it out and it is all right and by this time we are getting pretty, uh, inebriated, I guess you'd call it, and, uh, we were out there just acting stupid on the jet skis.
         And, uh, at one point in time he actually runs into me on my jet ski and, uh, bends the handle bars and runs up on my legs and I got a big bruise on my legs, but I'm not feeling it then, I'm pretty well gone by this time.
         And, uh, it's getting late in the afternoon and he says he has to get home, and he doesn't live on the lake so we load up his jet ski and, uh, put it on the trailer on the back of my truck and uh, we're going to go back to his house to take it back.
         So, uh, we get it back on the trailer and we find out that, uh, we bent the handlebar on it.
         So we take it back to my house and, uh, we are sitting there trying to bend it back and, uh, so his parents don't get mad at him that he messed up his jet ski or whatever.
         So, uh, we are at the house trying to bend it back and my parents come down and they are like, "Are y'all all right?"
         We're like, "Yeah, yeah we're fine," you know.
         And uh, they're like, "All right," but they, they didn't have any idea that we were, uh, that we were leaving and we were going to take the, uh, jet ski back to his house.
         They thought we were just going to stay at the house.
         So, uh, we get the handlebar bent back and, uh, we take off and, um, we are on the way to his house, and uh, I run off the road at one point.
         And, uh, the trailer, the trailer doesn't hit anything but at one point it hits a mailbox, and my friend asked if I was all right and I said, "Sure I'm fine," you know, I had no idea what I was doing so we get to his house and, uh, I found out my parent's had, uh, called over there beforehand to tell his parents to come out there and meet me and take me home when I got there.
         Well when I got there, uh, I just rolled in there we dropped the jet skis off, and I just jetted right out all of the sudden, you know his parents didn't even know we had got there, and, uh, my friend Eric and he asked me again, "Are you OK to drive?"
         and I was like, "Yeah sure," you know.
         I mean I thought I was fine, obviously I wasn't.
         But uh, I'm coming on the way home and not really paying that much attention and, uh, just got this truck about a year ago before this, and, uh, end up not looking at the road I don't know what the heck I was doing.
         And, uh, ran my truck into a telephone pole.
         And I had the window open.
         I didn't know it was happening, and, uh, the side view mirror glass all of the sudden I just felt this bang, and I looked up and I saw I had glass on me.
         And I was in the truck, I didn't know what was wrong.
         And I swerved and uh, luckily enough the truck hit the front fender somehow and I bounced off the telephone pole, and it was still going and, uh, I had no, I mean I was just totally in shock.
         I didn't know what was going on.
         And, uh, ( ) the truck and I'm like I am all right.
         The first thing I do is I got a cell phone on me so I call, uh, I call a friend of mine that, uh, lives real close to where I hit the telephone pole is at.
         And I drive to her house and, uh, I get her to uh, drive my truck the rest of the way home.
         And I call my parent's up on the way home and tell them what happened.
         Um, what not--.
         () Ended up taking about all my summer wages that I earned that summer to pay to fix it.
         One of the hardest lessons to learn.

         Um, when do you remember hearing stories as a child?
      
      
         Uh, I remember hearing stories as a child when basically my mother reading stories to me, not so much my father, but more my mother when I was, I can't even tell you how old I was.
         But I just, I know for a fact as a child my mother would read to me before I went to bed.
      
      
         Do you remember any stories?
      
      
         Um, there was one book that I always remember.
         I don't know if my mother ever finished it.
         But one sticks out and it's still, um, at our home in New York and whenever I go back up there I always see the book lying around, um, in my room actually, or on the bookshelf.
         And it's actually called the Trumpet of the Swan.
         So that's, that's the, that's the main story that I remember that, that sticks in my head, as far as my mother reading it to myself and my sister when we were younger.
      
      
         Can you tell a little bit about it or do you remember anything?
      
      
         Um, I think the one thing I remember mostly about it actually is just the, the front cover of it.
         And it was just a, uh, uh a small boy, it looked like, on the edge of a lake and he was doing something, either like feeding, you know, the swan, or holding out his hand to it, or something to that effect.
         But the actual, um, the actual plot of the story, I probably don't really remember.
      
      
         Do you remember hearing stories that your parents would tell you as a child, maybe about their past or--?
      
      
         Oh, yeah.
         I can remember my, uh, my father telling me, um, the story of my grandparents coming from, uh, Italy when, uh, they came over.
         Um, so that kind of stands clearly in my mind.
         I also remember, uh, my mother telling me a lot of stories about, uh, how hard it was for her when she was growing up because, uh, there was about, I think she was one of, um, four siblings and um, my grandmother never really worked or anything like that.
         She was always taking care of the kids.
         And my grandfather was always working like about three different jobs.
         So I remember my mother telling me all kinds of interesting stories about my grandfather, as far as, uh, he was a New York City cop, um, you know, and worked in a, he was a bailiff in, in court, you know, for the New York courts for awhile, like at the same time actually, and he was also doing like a, a security job as well.
         So, those kind of stories.
      
      
         Hmm.
         Do you read stories now?
      
      
         Uh, I read books and, and magazines, if that, that counts as, as stories.
      
      
         What kind?
         What do you tend towards?
      
      
         I tend to read, uh, mostly, uh, fiction books.
         I'm not really, uh, into, uh, a lot of the non-fictions, though occasionally I'll read a biography or, uh, something like that if, if, you know, I see something in a bookstore.
         But, uh, yeah, I read a lot of non-fiction.
         Um, I like fantasy-type stories `cause I always liked that when I was younger.
         The, The Dungeons and Dragons type stuff and even up until, um, you know, I still enjoy reading that kind of stuff about, you know, swords and magic, that kind of stuff.
         And I've actually always, uh, enjoyed stuff, reading books about like vampires.
         Like, you know, fiction books about, uh, vampires and, and that kind of stuff.
         And I also tend to, um, hear about authors from, you know, friends or, or hear of a famous book from a friend and I'll read one and if there happens to be a series on it then, you know, I'll start reading those.
         I actually just started reading, uh, the first three books of the Harry Potter series and I think those are intended for a much younger audience, but I've actually read all, the first three that have come out and I've enjoyed them `cause that's basically, it's about a kid who's a magician, basically, finds out that he's a magician.
         So that kind of, you know, peaked my interest when I started reading it.
      
      
         So when you first started to read you tended towards the fantasy books?
      
      
         Um, yeah when I started to be able to decide what I wanted to read, as opposed to having somebody read it to me, I tended to lean more towards, yeah, fantasy-type books.
      
      
         Is there a story that changed in significance as you've gotten older?
         Like maybe you've read, you remember hearing a book, and then you heard it again or read it again that changed in meaning or meant something different to you?
      
      
         Uh, yeah actually.
         I remember, my parents actually read to me, um, Watership Down, which is a story about a bunch of rabbits who, um, get driven out of wherever they're living, I forget the technical term for, for what their home under, under the ground is called, but they get driven out of that and they have to go and basically find a new place to live.
         And I remember my parents read that to me.
         It's a really big, long book.
         The paperback book is like about like six hundred pages long.
         So I remember my parents read that to me and I thought it was just really like cute about the rabbits kind of thing.
         And I think they might have skipped a lot of pages, too, because I actually read it in high school and it turns out it was like, you know, somewhat of a violent book.
         Like some of the rabbits get killed and it's, it's much more deeper and it's actually, it has like political undertones to it `cause it's, you know, different factions of rabbits you know, kind of like fighting against each other and, you know, it was really interesting.
         So that, that kind of, that story like, I remember being younger and hearing it and thinking like oh, it was cute because it was rabbits and then reading it and actually, you know, en, enjoying it a lot more when I was in high school `cause it was actually a really, really good book.
      
      
         Um, do you or would you like to read to children?
      
      
         Uh, yes.
         I, I'd read to children, but probably not, I'd probably tend to read to my own children.
         Um, I don't know how much I'd be into reading to just, you know, like a, a program of just reading to children kind of thing.
         But when I do have children, I'm going make sure that either, um, you know, my wife reads to them or that, you know, or make it a point that I read to them `cause I think it's, it's really important.
         And actually, uh, my sister has two young children and, um, she's constantly reading to, to her child and, who's two years old now.
         And she just seems like a pretty bright, intelligent kid compared to some other two year olds that I've, that I've encountered.
      
      
         Are there any personal stories about your past and history and growing up that you're going to tell your children?
      
      
         Um, yeah.
         I'm sure that there's going be stories that I'll, I'll tell them about.
         Um, to tell you the truth, I'll definitely tell my kids, you know, things about, you know, stories about when I was growing up and maybe some things that, you know, you should or shouldn't do.
         Um, in particular I could, I could think of a few things.
         Um, I know when I was really younger, I'll tell them this story, about never going near, uh, a frozen pond because when I was really young, um, the lake by my house had frozen over, actually it was just a pond, but it was a pretty big one, um, and we always use to play ice hockey and what not on it.
         And it started to um, get warmer outside, but there was still a layer of ice on top of it, and a bunch of my friends had gone out on to the, the dock.
         That is, you know, you could easily get to it.
         It was attached to kind of like the shore, but at the deep end of the pond.
         And we were out there and one of my friends was kidding around, and I think we were in like, about seven or eight years old.
         Um, and one of my friends was joking around on it and actually fell through the ice.
         And, uh, a bystander had to come over and basically fish him out and the kid could've died.
         So, I'll tell my kids to, to stay away from thin ice.
      
      
         Do you think your parents told you stories more out of humor or more out of, as a warning?
         Like about, stories about growing up with them or their past.
         Do you think they used their stories as teachable moments?
      
      
         Yeah, I think they had a mixture because I think, um, it's kind of like two different, you know, things that they would tell me as far as stories.
         You had the things that they would read out of books, which were purely for entertainment, it always seemed like.
         Um, and then if it was anything that was, you know, that I kind of correlated with, if it wasn't coming from a book, they were probably trying to get something into my head.
         You know, trying to like, you know, teach me something in some way.
         So it was kind of like if it was coming out of book, I knew it was for pure entertainment, whereas if it was something they were telling to me, I might be a little more receptive to, you know, maybe trying to find a little, a little meaning behind it and say, " Hey, why are you, why are you telling me this?"
      
      
         Now, your grandparents or great-grandparents came from Italy?
      
      
         Uh, my grandparents.
      
      
         So your grandparents, had they told you stories about Italy?
      
      
         Oh yeah.
      
      
         Can you think of anything?
      
      
         Um, yeah, I mean they just, they mostly, they didn't really talk about what it was like being over there.
         I mean, they more talked about, um, coming over here.
         Like from the time when they came over here that was hard for them at first to adjust.
         And how they came over with, with basically, you know, nothing or you know, not, not that many possessions looking for a, looking for a better life and you know, just how they had to work hard to get, you know, where they were.
         And that they, their entire lives they were just trying to make a better life for my dad and his sister.
         So I didn't really hear too many stories about, um, you know, where they came from.
         But more of like the actual journey over and, and what it was like to first come here.
      
      
         OK.
         I think I've got everything.
         Thank you.
      
      
         You're welcome.
      
   

   
   
      
         OK.
         This is David Emrich and he also grew up in Philadelphia and he's lived in Charlotte for, is it almost three years.
         Is that right?
      
      
         Three years.
      
      
         Um, and, I'll ask you the same questions as well.
         When you were growing up, do you remember reading a book that uh, you particularly liked and you remember or do you remember someone reading you a book that you particularly liked?
      
      
         See.
         When I was growing up the books I remember the most of were like The Hardy Boys Mysteries and Frank Swift and those kind of, really, um, you know, just serial, serializations of books and those were the books that I remember first.
         I don't remember any specific mysteries or anything like that I just remember reading
         dozens of them really, until I was probably seven or eight years old.
      
      
         Is there any particular reasons why you chose those books to read over others?
      
      
         I think that I was given them as a gift.
         The other, because I would, and they kept giving me gifts of books because they knew, knew I liked to read.
         And they were, it would, it would generally be series and like for example I remember, now I, now I recall uh, I'd gotten a series, uh, they'd come in box sets at Christmas and they'd be paperbox, paperbacks in a box with a eight or ten books in them.
         And I remember reading, like, uh I remember reading Sherlock Holmes mysteries this way and I remember reading books by J.RR.
         Tolkien uh, you know Lord of the Rings,
         and you know all those books the same way.
         So I guess that these were the, I mean my parents knew I liked to read and I would always for Christmas or my birthdays or, or um you know anytime
         a gift was appropriate.
         These were the kind of gifts that I would get.
         I would get other gifts, of course, but not only also get something like this every year.
      
      
         
         Were, I mean, obviously, your parents thought reading was important because they'd give you books because they knew you liked to read.
         Did they, like, when you were younger maybe you couldn't read, did they ever read anything to you that you remember?
      
      
         Hum.
         
         No, I don't recall anything like that, it doesn't mean it didn't happen.
         It just means I don't recall it.
      
      
         Hum.
         Um
         did, as you got older, did they types of book change?
         Did you still like mystery type books?
      
      
         As I got older?
         
         Let's see--
      
      
         You know, ten, eleven or twelve--
      
      
         By the time I got to be ten, eleven or twelve, I mean, I remember I would read the books that were assigned in school and I really like those, like, you know, the seventh grade readers, usually that John Knowles, A Separate Peace I remember reading that and it was very good and I remember reading um, um, Lord of the Flies by Sir William Golding which was, was the type of book that was assigned then.
         Um, even then I used to like to read histories.
         I remember reading very specifically, uh, uh, history of the German rocketry program during WWII that reading, you know--
      
      
         
            
         
      
      
         I was just
         a thirteen or fourteen year old boy.
         Uh, I remember, actually, I remember reading a book, it was on the best seller list at the time, it was uh, it was probably written in the late seventies and it was called The Third World War and it was, it was uh, it was written as if it were factual but it was uh um, sort of a fictionalized account of what of a, of a potential third world war and I remember the funny thing, I remember was I read this book like after it was probably `77 or `78 and the war took place, according to this book in like `85 or '86.
         I wouldn't say I lived in dread, but I always a little afraid of that year--
      
      
         
            
         
      
      
         That this was the year that these, these events would come true and that there would be a Third World War.
         In fact, I remember, it was seventh grade
         .
         I remember because in this particular book, the Soviet Union, at that point, had used, um, nuclear weapons against Birmingham, England, um, and I had, uh, and that's what caused their coalition to unravel because none of the coalition partners wanted any part of that and that was what eventually caused them to lose the war.
         But I remember doing a creative writing piece for a seventh grade reading class um, where I invented a series of newspaper articles surrounding that particular event.
         The fact that the Soviet Union had launched nuclear attacks various parts, various uh, you know, cities around the world.
      
      
         So you used what you had read to actually, you, you wrote about things you'd actually read?
      
      
         Yeah, I'd--
      
      
         Created your own writing system?
      
      
         Actually, what I did was I imagined that this was, that I was a news reporter writing for the New York Times or whatever--
      
      
         Hum.
      
      
         And I you know, made up a big headline, you know, "Such And Such a City Destroyed," you know, give a by-line, you know, give a date and time and then just start writing what I, what I thought were journalistic articles at that point about that event, event which I had read about in a book, which I had imagined.
      
      
         Hum.
      
      
         Um-hum.
      
      
         Um, did, do you remember any particular stories that were told to you when you were a child?
      
      
         Well, ah, I don't remember my parents reading anything I do remember being in grade school and being in the library and the librarian reading James and the Giant Peach to us.
         And we would go to, I forget how often we'd go to library, like, you know, maybe it was once a week, maybe it was three times a week but everytime we'd go we'd all sit on the rug we'd sit Indian- style, cross-legged and, uh, I'm sure it's very politically incorrect at this point, but the librarian could never say that today.
         Um, and then she would read us, you know, chapter at a time of James and the Giant Peach.
      
      
         Did you look forward to reading or hearing her read James and the Giant Peach?
      
      
         Yeah, sure did, I think, think I enjoyed James and the Giant Peach.
      
      
         Hum.
      
      
         In fact, I remember a few years ago they made a movie of it and I thought, "I ought to go see that," but I guess it didn't do so well and it fizzled and I never saw it, no.
      
      
         Hum.
         Do ever go back and reread the things that you read when you were younger, now?
      
      
         Uh--
      
      
         Maybe not now but you know within the last four or five years?
      
      
         Right.
         I don't re, remember rereading anything.
         Besides, um, things like, you know first off what I mentioned before, it would, it could be adult reading like, um, A Separate Peace or Lord of the Flies I remember rereading those in college just because I wanted to reread them.
         Um, but I don't, I don't remember rereading anything that I read when I was a kid that, that I, that I reread as an adult.
      
      
         
         OK.
         
         Um.
         Do you, like now, um, I asked Megan the same question, but now do you, are there any family stories that you either remember or, you like think are bizarre or you know, would like to hear again?
      
      
         
         
         Well, I mean, I don't think that, uh, my family generally, doesn't sit around telling stories about what people did years ago or that kind of thing, years ago, there is one event I remember, um, no, I mean there's a few things, a few things I remember, or have memories of, but it isn't like anyone sits around telling stories about them.
         Certainly the memory I have is different than the stories that, that uh,
         the family swaps around the table or anything like that.
      
      
         
         So, like, you remember specific events?
      
      
         
         I remember general things, I remember one time, we were at the shore, my fam, my grandfather had a house in Stone Harbor and there was a hurricane and I remember, um, you know, we moved all the furniture inside for the hurri, hurricane and we went out and he had an awning over his porch and, you know, and we, we double-tied the awning down.
         During the hurricane we'd go out and check to make sure that uh, uh, you know, all the strings were still tied and the awning wasn't going to blow away, but I don't remember, you now, I don't think we'd sit around and telling that story I mean, I occasionally mention that.
         "Do you remember?"
         "Does anyone remember that story?"
         That, that kind of thing that.
      
      
         You don't elaborate on it much?
      
      
         
         No, no, but I remember it, like, um, most of my memories of, of, childhood memories, I guess were, were of that beach house and you know, my grandmother, and my mother and my sisters would stay there during the week and then on the weekend the men would come down, like the men meaning my grandfather, and my father and that kind of thing.
      
      
         Um hum.
      
      
         
         But, I don't remember, we, we, don't generally sit around and swapping stories about it, I mean, we just
         last week we were at, the whole family again, went to this time a North Carolina beach.
         My Mom rented a house there and we, you know, I think at that point just because, you know, being at the beach I remember things and I would say, "You remember when we used to do this or that and the other thing and?"
         We talked about some other things then, but it wasn't like we sat around telling hilarious tales and laughing over dinner and things like that.
      
      
         
         OK.
         Thank you very much.
      
      
         Well, you're welcome very much.
      
   

   
   
      
         All right, this is, um, Megan Emrich and she, she grew up in Philadelphia and she's lived here since May?
         April?
         March?
         April?
      
      
         April first.
      
      
         April first.
      
      
         April first.
      
      
         All right, Megan, when you were growing up, do you remember any stories that you read or were read to you that uh, stick in your mind?
      
      
         I don't remember any stories that I read.
         I remember reading, the uh, um, my Nana, and we were just talking about this at Christmastime, my Nana had read a story, had wanted me to read a book, and we had gone to her apartment and she was um, reading The Owl and the Pussycat, and she would read it with me, I think, just to teach me how to, how to read, basically, but I remember and apparently, that was her favorite story or something like that, but I remember being forced to sit down and read it with her and I really didn't want to do it, but I always remember.
         I can remember now the beginning part of it and that's really all I can
         remember of the story.
      
      
         OK.
         Did, um, was this at a particular time of the year, like did you say at Christmas or holidays?
      
      
         Whenever.
         This was not at Christmas, this was whenever we would go over and visit, visit her.
         She always made me sit down and read this
         book.
         I don't even know, The Owl and the Pussycat, the book or a poem, I'm not really sure.
         She always sat down and read this with her and I, I always thought I was being punished by sitting there, having to read it.
         I guess she really liked it and she wanted me to learn it.
      
      
         OK.
         Um, Did, did she, like read it to you or--
      
      
         She would read it with me.
         She'd read it with me.
      
      
         She'd have to actually read the words.
      
      
         Yeah.
         She'd actually have to read the words.
      
      
         Did you like the story?
      
      
         No.
      
      
         
            
         
      
      
         I didn't like anything about it because I thought I was being punished.
         But I could always remember, you know, The Owl and the Pussycat in the beautiful pea-green book and that's what I remember, but I don't really remember enjoying it.
         I just thought I was being punished because every, my brother and sister could do whatever they wanted, and I had to sit there and read The Owl and the Pussycat you know, I wasn't too happy about that.
      
      
         Do you know why she made you sit there?
         Did she ever make your brother and sister sit there?
      
      
         No!
         I don't remember them having to sit there.
         I don't really know why I had to sit there.
         I don't know.
      
      
         She did this every time you'd go over there like on a regular basis?
      
      
         Yeah!
         It seemed like it.
         This was before, this was when my grandfather and her weren't married so we would go over and read it with me I was not even sure what was going on, but um,
         , but I just remember having to read that and that was it um, with her.
      
      
         OK.
         Do you remember in your family, any particular stories that were told, like you know at Thanksgiving or just, maybe even now stories that you uh, know you remember when so and so did such and such?
      
      
         Um, no, but I always, not really stories, I guess hearing my mom talk about stories about her, her brother and her mother and stuff like that, things I never even knew about that would interest me now that she tells me now.
         But I don't remember um, being told a whole lot when we were younger.
      
      
         Um.
      
      
         It was just, you know, we just went on with our lives, but now, now as I am older she would tell me things that, you know, I never even knew about.
         Lived with, we lived with the whole time, but I never even knew about, so, it was a little different.
      
      
         Is there something particular or like really weird that she's told you that stands out in your mind.
      
      
         Well, she told me, she just told me last week that my, her mother had breast cancer and I never knew that.
      
      
         Wow!
      
      
         I never knew that.
         And she had tuberculosis
         and I never knew that either.
      
      
         
         Is there any reason why she didn't tell you?
      
      
         I don't know.
         
         It never came up, I don't think she ever, you know, she ever kept it a secret or anything like that, but I don't, I just, she just never told me, it never came out in conversation.
         Um, and that's just more of those every day, I don't think there's any, I don't know.
         No, I don't think there's any reason why she doesn't tell me anything I don't think.
         Maybe she told everyone else and I wasn't paying attention at that particular time.
         So I'm not really sure why.
         Um, as far as never being told--
      
      
         OK.
         Um, are there any, you said you don't remember reading anything in particular, like when you were older in school, were there any books that you read that you liked or hated?
      
      
         
         Um, no, to be honest, I never read any of the books I was supposed to.
         I know that's horrible.
         That's why I didn't graduate college, but I never, I never read any of the books I was supposed to.
         I mean, I remember having to read um, you know, all the, all the books that everyone, I don't know, John Steinbeck books and stuff like that.
         Um, but I don't recall ever finishing any of them.
         And more looking through the Cliff Notes to be honest with you.
         So, I don't have any specific stories.
      
      
         OK.
         Um-hum.
      
      
         I don't know.
         
      
      
         OK, all right.
         That's fine.
         Thank you very much.
      
   

   
   
      
         One of my first memories, uh, occurred when I was about four years old.
         I was living, uh, right outside of St. Louis, between Jefferson City and St. Louis, MO.
         Um, my parents had a small house on a very friendly suburban street and, ah, one summer day I remember going out to the back of our yard, which seemed really big then.
         Uh, I reached into my parents small garden, it had quite a few tomatoes in it, and I just started lobbing the tomatoes over the fence, and I kept lobbing the tomatoes over the fence, and then my next door neighbor, who was probably about four, my playmate at the time, he rode his Big Wheel down the, down the hill there and came and started throwing the tomatoes with me and we were just having a great time not thinking about anything, laughing having a lot of fun
      .
         Then dad had to spoil it all.
         He came, he opened the door and I remember looking back and seeing the expression on his face, and I could tell that he was disappointed.
         He wasn't happy with me, but I wasn't, I wasn't really sure if what I had done was really, really wrong I just knew that he wasn't very happy about what was going on by the way he opened the door and by the way he told me I needed to come into the house, and I, I came over there and I stepped up and I didn't even say, "Bye," to my friend and was probably not into that kind of thing I didn't really notice at that time probably I just went into the house.
         And Dad said he had noticed, he had seen me throwing tomatoes in Mrs. Faulk's yard, so he told me that I was in trouble and I was going to get a spanking, and, um, I was kind of uh, uh looking for an out so I was smart enough to say, "Hey Dad!
         Before you give me a spanking, why don't you just let me have one big glass of chocolate milk first?"
         So anyway, Dad goes and makes this nice big glass of chocolate milk for me.
         I'm not even sure why he did it but I spent so much time drinking that chocolate milk, it was, I must have had that chocolate milk to my face for 20 minutes, and for some reason, you know, Dad was telling me, you know, talking to me about, uh, you know, what, what I had done and, you know, how it was wrong.
         I remember, yeah I remember that based on later conversations that I ( ) with him about it, but at the time I guess I really wasn't sure what it was about, but I knew
      that when it all came down to the bottom of it, I knew that what I had done was the wrong thing to do and he told me that I'm going to probably have to go down there and help Mrs. Faulk pick up the tomatoes when it's all said and done, and I remember being a little bit nervous about that.
         I didn't really know Mrs. Faulk very well she was about 80 and, ah, she was a nice person I had seen her a few times but I was really nervous about that.
         It was probably the first thing I remember from being a little kid about, ah, especially about something that I'd done wrong.
         Ah, another thing that happened there that I thought was interesting was one of the first memories of my sister, and that was in that very same backyard.
         There was a, ah, a rose garden back there and my sister, it's ironic her middle name is Rose.
         Her name is Christy Rose Farrow, and she was back there with me and we're going back and seeing these roses and Christy was smelling the roses and she started to put the petals up her nose, and I remember watching her put the petals up there, and I remember watching her put the petals up her nose, and I wasn't really sure why she was doing it.
         I didn't really ask any questions I just thought it was interesting that she was putting the petals up her nose, and it kind of became fun to kind of cheer her into keep doing it, so I was like keeping going, keep going, "Yes!
         This is great!"
         you know, and she's stuffing the petals up there and I didn't really know of any consequences.
         I don't think, I was just kind of, I was about four or four and a half and I remember stuffing those petals up her nose and I thought it was great and then Mom comes down and she was really disappointed in both of us.
         I think she was most unhappy with me because, you know, ah, ah, Christy was only one or one and a half or two and I was the big brother so from there I guess I remembered mom being upset with me because ah Christy had all those petals up her nose and it took a long time to take them out there was a lot of them up there, but, ah, later on, as I grew older, we moved around a lot when I was a kid I remember the first day I woke up and there was a moving truck.
         One day I woke up and there was a moving truck in my, in my yard and I woke up to this sound of that and I looked out the window and there's this moving truck and there's people moving stuff in and I got up and I said, "Mom they're taking our stuff," and I was, and she was like, "Yes, we're moving today," and I was about four going on five at the time and so they're taking our stuff out so anyway we moved and they took all our stuff out and moved and she said, you know, "I told you we're moving.
         You must have forgot," and I must have because it totally took me by surprise, and we ended up at a new place and I remember this, this new house that we were at and, ah, in a pretty area and it had a much bigger yard than the one.
         I remembered a long driveway and it was surrounded by woods it was really nice area in Arnold, MO and, um, basically it was such a shock because when we first got there Mom said, "Today's your first day of school," and apparently I had forgot about that too and I started to get really nervous about that.
         We were watching something on TV.
         I can't remember what it was but I suddenly got really nervous that I was about to go to school for the first time and that was probably the most stressful day of my life.
         I had forgotten that I was moving to a new place and I had forgotten that I was, uh, going to be going to school.
         That was, that was a pretty scary day.
         Um, then we moved to a new house.
         Ah, oops!
         I'm covering the same stuff.
         Ah, fourth grade was a lot of fun.
         I like to laugh.
         I was probably, just laugh about anything.
         I remember, some of my friends, I remember one time when I went to lunch, and I always had this Pac Man lunchbox, pull out this Pac Man lunchbox, and I would, that I was so proud of, and, you know, do my thing, and I would be talking so much and laughing about the stupidest things that I wouldn't even, I wouldn't even eat my lunch.
         I would just laugh the whole time, and one time I did it so much that I never even opened my lunch out of the bag, and it was like a minute before, a minute before lunch was over and the teacher, the P.E. teacher came up to me, and he said, "Look, this is horrible, Thomas.
         This is just," you know, "Look you're in trouble.
         You're not eating your lunch," come with him, so I went, he, I had to follow him and remember being really nervous and he sat me down a corner and he told me I had to sit there until I ate all my lunch, and I remember, um, crying for a long time and I think that basically what happened there was that was just an amazing mood swing because I went from being extremely
      happy, and I was
      extremely sad.
         It was an amazing mood swing.
         I think that's why I remember that.
         Um, when I was young we used to go on a lot of yearly vacations.
         Every year we'd go from, whether it be MO to IL or IO to IL or KS to IL, the whole time I was growing up because in IL that's where my grandparents lived and every year we'd go up there and spend about a week with them in the summer, and we'd also go down there for Christmas too, but mostly I remember going down there every year, um, for the summer and it was, ah, a lot of arguing in the car, and I remember sitting next to my, uh, I had two sisters, so the middle one was always in the middle, for some reason.
         She was, she was, uh, the middle one's always in the middle.
         What I mean by that is that she's the next down she was like two, two years younger that me then the other one is three years younger than me, so, uh, basically, you know, you know, she would always sit next to me, and we'd get so mad, I remember my dad swinging directly behind him at us all the time because we'd always be fighting.
         One thing that she really had as a great defense.
         Was, she would eat peanut butter cups, and she knows that I hate the smell of peanut butter, so she would actually eat the peanut butter cup and then breathe in my face and there wasn't really any way for me to defend against that because I couldn't think of any food that she really thought stunk and you know it was like it was it was untouchable there wasn't anything I could do about that, so I would, I would get really mad at that and I'd say, "Mom, Mom," and she would say, you know, "She's just breathing," so there was really no way out of it, so I remember a lot of that.
         So when I was in, when I was at grandma and grandpa's house, we used to have a great time just fishing and hanging out with grandpa, and my cousins would go there and every Fourth of July we'd do fireworks.
         Um, it was on the river and it was, ah, it was very peaceful.
         Um, my grandparents were always very, very loving people and some of, my parents were and we'd just have a great time down there.
         And some of my best memories were, um, at the Fox River in IL with my grandparents.
         Um, um another memory with my family that I have is that we had a lot of weddings, ah, and these weddings were always really big weddings, and I've always been told the reason why they're so big is because basically it's Polish, you know.
         Half of my family's Polish, so Polish, we have big weddings and I remember at my cousin's wedding I was like 12 years old going to it and I had a my cousin Tim and he was about 10, and, ah we went to this wedding and it has like 200 people.
         My uncle, he's a great guy.
         He's also really big into the Hell's Angels and he brought about 50 of his friends to it and the wedding took place in a hotel one of those classic areas where you have, you have the weddings, and it was, ah, basically a really stormy night, real stormy and the power went out, and it was open bar so now we've got, ah, 50 Hell's Angels, no power, and it's the middle a summer, so it is getting really hot in there, you know, there's, there's no lights so you know there's a few emergency power lights that people brought, ah, and they had some sort of battery they were using for the ah for the radio system and it was, it was getting really crazy in there because we had Hell's Angels running around without shirts on, uh, people highly intoxicated, I remember by 10 year old cousin saying, "Bottom's up, Thomas!
         Bottoms up!"
         and the reason it was bottoms up was because, was, they serve champagne to everybody in these weddings that's something I can never figure out and if you're a kid you get champagne, if you're an adult you get champagne.
         Everybody gets champagne and some people don't drink it so what's left the kids drink so we were going around drinking all this champagne.
         And before you know it it's time for the kids Hula Hoop contest and they've got a stage of course there they do it's one of those huge areas and ah we get up there and they're playing this tune I can't remember what it was and Tim and I were up there and Tim my 10 year old cousin is really drunk and he fell completely off the stage I remember that being somewhat embarrassing but looking back on it I think it's really pretty funny, um, it was uh it was a really neat experience.
      
   

   
   
      
         Male Voice START OF TAPE 1 AT 6:00, SIDE A
      
      
         Will it be loud enough?
      
      
         Should be.
      
      
         So, Friday morning, right, I'm at work.
         I get a call, it's about 9:30 in the morning and I get a call from the partner, Bucky, the big man.
         And he's like talking all fast; he's on a cell phone.
      
      
         Uh-huh.
         AF: "I need you to do something for me."
         Um, "You need to call Ramona at Concord," mind you she's at an office, actually she's in a client, all the way across town, we're in Monroe, she's in Concord.
         "You need to call Ramona.
         She can help you; she's done this for me before.
         There's some cash flow projections on my desk and, um, uh, it's for such and such Cutty," that's the client's name.
         "He's buying a new business and it's four million in inventory and 12 million in fixed assets and so, they can have 12 million in debt, and four million in equity," and mind you, I'm writing this down.
         He's like just, spitting everything out.
         And um, so I'm writing all this down, and he's like, "Ramona did such and such at the office, she did this for me, she did the same thing for me, she can tell you what you know, she can help you out," whatever.
         Hang up the phone with him.
         "I'll call you back in about an hour," he says.
         Hang up with him and I'm like, "Aw damn, all that information," you know, and I don't know if I remembered everything.
         I tried to jot everything down.
         So then I look up, I find out where Ramona's at, and I call her over there.
         She's like, "Well, I did that for him, like at least two years ago."
         And I'm like, "Damn, great."
         She's like, "But you need to look here, look here," she's gives me like three different places to look in the computer.
      
      
         Uh-huh.
      
      
         And um, it's different, like under each client, is all their files.
         Like whatever we've done for them, it's in there.
         So I have to go, she gave me like three or four clients to look up, and then under each one of those I have to like open up all like the Excel spreadsheets, and I don't even know what I'm looking for!
         I'm just trying to have an idea of what it kind of looks like.
         So it took me like, an hour to two hours just to find what I needed.
         Then I get it and I'm like great, "What do I do with it?"
         It's like one file with a whole bunch of tabs, of different, you know, each tab has like a different spreadsheet on it.
      
      
         What's up Angelina?
      
      
         We're talking about my
         .
      
      
         Recording me?
      
      
         Yeah it's recording.
      
      
         ( )
      
      
         ( )
         So, finally I get the thing and it has like eight different parts to it, and I'm just there trying to figure how the thing goes together, how one number flows to another sheet and how that goes, you know.
         Everything is linked, and gosh, I don't even know how long.
         I was just there just trying to figure it out.
         Then I was spinning my wheel for about, I don't know, it seemed like all day that day.
         It wasn't till like 11:30 or 12:00 that I actually got to start on the on the project.
         And I um, I didn't know how much detail he wanted.
         I didn't know, you know, when he needed it by.
         He acted like, he needed it soon, but the way she had everything done, I would have had to, I would have had to start from the very beginning, and most of it was just like data entry to start off with.
         And then once you get everything entered you can go on from there.
         Well, the rest of the day I was just entering, entering, entering, entering information.
         It wasn't until like before 5:00 that I had finished entering something and I was able to look and see, "OK where do I go from here now that I have this done, where do these totals go to, on another sheet?"
         So I'm like, "OK he hasn't called back or anything," so I'm figuring I can do it on Monday.
         Well I get there this morning and um, I forget how, I think either I asked a question and he came in there or, whatever.
         Anyhow, he tells me, "Well I need it by today because such and such is coming, coming in and we need to take it to the bank."
         And I'm like, "Oh."
         I'm like, I know how far I've gotten.
         So anyhow, I call Ramona back because I had a question about, I was like, "All right, let me hurry up on with it," and I had a question about something I was doing.
         Well, she tells me, she's like, "That doesn't sound right."
         She was like, um, you know, because the company she gave me was different from the company that I had, there were little things different, slight different things with it, like, one didn't have the same kind of inventory as the other one.
         Little things like that made a big difference in what I was trying to do.
         So, she's like, "Well look, look up this in such and such company."
         And I did.
         Now what does that look like?
         And how about it looks like exactly what I'm trying to do.
         It's like more simplified, like the one that she had given me was all detailed and complicated and the second one is all simple.
         So here I am, now I have the thing that I'm supposed to have and he wants it today, and I wasted all that time on Friday, just wasted time, because I was doing the wrong thing.
         So now, here it is, he wants it today.
         I didn't have time to enter in all kinds of whatever.
         So I just had to take the totals and try and figure it like that.
         Well, I get to a certain point where I'm like confused.
         I don't have enough information.
         So, I go in there, and I haven't even told him yet that I had to start from the very beginning, because I was like, I didn't want to tell him!
         So and let me tell you I got to the point today where I was about to quit.
         I was like, "That's it.
         I'm getting up.
         I'm leaving," because when he had come in, it was like he was short with me and I'm asking him a question and he's not answering it and he's his final thing was, "Well I need it by such and such meeting," so, just telling me, "I don't give a damn that you're having trouble.
         I don't care how you get it done," he just wants it.
         Well, there's nobody there to help me.
         The girl that can help me is all the way across town.
         So, with that, I was, I was frustrated.
         I was spinning my wheels trying to figure out how I can make it work.
         If there was anything I could do.
         Lana came over and sat with me for a little bit, but she didn't know what to do, and um, you just get to the point where, you know, you're like, you know, you're slamming things down, and you're just, I was pissed, I was really upset, and um, got to the point where I just wanted to cry, and, but I didn't want to get that upset because, you know, if anybody came in there or I knew I had to tell him that I would I might not be able to finish it today, or, you know, I have to start from the beginning, but, then again, I didn't know how much detail, I still didn't know how much detail, you know, I talked to him early in the day it's like you talk to him, and it's like he completely avoided my questions.
         So anyhow, I think I spoke to Ramona again.
         No, it was just that one time in the morning, and she said that she was going to come back to the office.
         Well, I wasn't even thinking about that, but I was so frustrated, and, I ended up talking to him again.
         Again he didn't answer my question but at least I got a little bit out of him.
         He told me what exactly he needed and that he did need it by today.
         He didn't say a time again, so he just got me over there stressing out, and I really don't even know when it's needed.
         But I was like, forget it, I'm going to eat lunch I was hungry.
         Usually you feel like you have to work through, like you just have to keep working because he needs it even though it wasn't your fault that he gave it to you at the very last minute, you know, I was like ( ), and then Lana calls me in the kitchen telling me Ramona had gotten here and I didn't even know she was coming for sure.
         This time I wasn't even happy that she was there because I was so stressed out.
         I was like, "OK, well that's good," you know, like that.
         Well anyway, I went back to my, my desk.
         I ate real quick, as fast as I could and then she came in there and she ended up helping me with it.
         It was like a little bit close to five when she came in there, and um, I had two companies that I had to do the same thing for so once I was finished with the whole first company, then I had to do the second one and it was like 5:00 and he hadn't asked for it or anything so, um.
         I e-mailed him because he's always on the phone.
         And I asked him, you know, could I do it, um, "Do you need me to stay and do it tonight or I could have it done by lunchtime tomorrow, if that's OK."
         Well, what happens the client walks through the door that needs it.
         So I'm like, "Oh my gosh," and Ramona was standing there.
         She was still in there.
         I didn't ask him till after she left, but anyhow, um, um she told me that he had come in she basically, um, no that was after.
         Anyhow the man comes in.
         She had gone already and she told me just don't worry about it.
         She's like, "Don't worry about it, you know, just take your time."
         Whatever.
         Yeah, well, the guy's here.
         He e-mails me back.
         Bruce is here.
         I need it now.
         And I only had one of them done and I just kept on doing what I was doing because I heard them talking or whatever and I kept on doing what I was doing I don't know how he did it but he basically told him that he didn't have it right now or whatever.
         And then I heard him leave, so I'm still finishing what I had to do.
         And here I am thinking he's going come in there and be like, you know, just have it out with me, you know, just tell me off like how could I not have this done.
         Even though I don't see how he could have expected me to have it done.
         I already told him, I tried to explain to him that I was frustrated I didn't have all the information I needed.
         But he didn't care.
         I spoke to him twice that day and it was like.
         So anyway, um, he ended up coming in there and he was like, "How's it coming along?"
         And I was like, "I'm almost done."
         He was like, "All right, well I'm going go out and run some errands, and um, just put it up on my shelf, and um, if I have any review notes I'll give them to you in the morning.
         And I was like "OK," and that was it!
         So all that stressing and I mean, I had every reason to stress today, it was like, you're giving something you don't know how to do, and it's like here do it.
         I don't care how you do it.
         I don't care how you get it done.
         I don't care if you don't know anything about it.
         And it makes you feel just awful.
         Anyhow, so I finished came home at 6:30 today and that was my day.
         That was my messed up.
         Boss, he was like with split personality man.
         One minute he's banging on the desk, the next he's OK, have it on my desk, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah.
         That's my story.
         I didn't talk long.
      
      
         Is it like that all the time?
      
      
         Yep whenever he there, um, which he's not there he's there most of the time but he is gone a lot but whenever he is there, and especially if he gives you something to do it's like you don't even want it because you know it's going to be that way and it's like other people hesitate to come through because they don't want to have said something wrong and then you go back to him well like, you know, such and such helped me and it's not like you're ratting anybody out you're just saying you know such and such helped me and that's how I got to this number but it's like people are hesitating basically and it's really frustrating.
      
      
         So what is it that they wanted you to do?
      
      
         We were doing, um
         , we were doing today it was, um projections it was financial statement like balance sheet and income statement projections for a company that, um, this guy was looking to buy, well he gave us the information that he had projected numbers for 2002- 2003 and we had to put those numbers into financial statements, basically saying they are going to have this much, um, this many assets and liabilities at the end of 2002 going to have 2003 and then going to have so much income, and you know, like that.
      
   

   
   
      
         This is Fannie Flono, and she grew up in Ag-- Augusta, GA, and she is going to talk about some stories from her
         childhood.
      
      
         Ok.
         My grandmother used to tell me a lot of different stories about her growing-up years and, uh, especially, uh, she used to talk about her family, and what it was like during those times.
         She had this one story, and, uh, we called my grandmother Granny, uh, because we had another grandmother we called something else, but uh, um Granny used to tell this story about her brother, Joe.
         And it was a fascinating story, because, uh, it kind of told a lot about, uh, what it was like being a uh, uh, close-knit black family during those, those years in the South when, uh, you didn't have much.
         She grew up on a farm, and um, uh, what it was like, but, um, like a lot of black families during that time,
         uh, uh, if you had a large family, uh, and some of your relatives didn't have anybody in their family, you would just kind of let some of the kids stay with that family.
         And my Gran, my Granny and her brother um, were among, I think there were six kids in her family, and they had a cousin, uh, who lived, uh, on a farm, you know, maybe about, I don't know, 10 miles away, not that far.
         You know, during that time people walked 10 miles and, uh, they needed somebody to help with some of the farm chores and all that sort of stuff and so they asked my, my, my Granny's parents if Joe could come and live with them.
         And you know, they were a close family and they loved each other and all that kind of stuff, but it was just down the road, you know, so they said fine, and, and you, you know, he came back on Sundays and he was with the family at church and all that sort of thing.
         Um, but, ah, one day he didn't show up, on Sunday, uh, for church and so they wondered what was going on and they went to this house, ah, down the road and the cousins had packed up and left.
         They had just gone.
         Nobody knew where they went.
         They took Joe with them, and my Granny said, she said it was such a sad time in the house because, you know, everybody was missing Joe and they didn't know what to do.
         And so you know, eventually, you know, you know, they kept asking people around, and nobody knew where they were, and eventually, you know, they just reconciled themselves that they just wouldn't see Joe again.
         And, uh, so uh, Granny grew up, she was like-- I think she told me this was when she was about 10 years old when this happened and her brother Joe was like 16 and, uh, so she grew up and, uh, she uh, got married, and uh, that's another story.
         She got married when she was 16 to my grandfather, who was 30, and she didn't know she had to go live with him, but anyway that's another story
         about ignorance, among people, but anyway they were sitting on the porch and she was back visiting uh, her mother, and they were sitting on the porch and it was like this long road, it was like the house was like situated at the end of this long road and you could see all the way down the road a, a long way.
         And she said it was just like one day, and it was like maybe 10 years later cause she was like 20, and they were just sitting on the porch, and they were, and she said, she said she could still remember because her mother had on, you know, this big straw hat that she used to have on.
         It was like her favorite hat, and this big voluminous dress that she used to have on in the summertime.
         It was really cool, and the dress kind of blew in the wind a little bit--
      
      
         Uh-huh.
      
      
         And they were just sitting out there on rocking chairs, you know, just kind of enjoying the afternoon and, uh, they could look down the road and they could see this dust kicking up.
         And, and, she said, uh my Granny said she got up and she, she looked up and she said, "You know, wonder who that could be?"
         And so she sat back down, and, you know, they were still chatting, and they could still see this person, and this person was walking really, really fast.
         And she said that her brother had this really distinctive walk and she said the more she looked at that person coming down that road she started thinking "No, that can't be, that can't be."
         And she said, but you know, the closer he got, she said she got up, and she peered down the road and she looked at her mom, and she said, she said, "Mama, you know, I think that's Joe."
         And she said then her mama, her mama leaned forward, and she looked and she said,
         "Walks like him.
         
         Got that same walk,"
         but she said, "It can't be."
         So Granny got up, and she kind of walked down the steps off the porch and she was walking up towards the road and she then just stood there.
         And then he was coming, she said he was coming really fast--she said could still remember all that dust kicking up on the road--and here he's coming down the road, and she turns around and she said, "It's Joe!
         He's come home!"
         And she said she started running toward him, and they ran and they hugged and they hugged and she said her mama was sitting on the porch and--this is a true story--and her mama was sitting on the porch, and she said her mama was just like dumbfounded.
         She didn't say a word--
      
      
         Aw.
      
      
         She said there were just tears coming down from her eyes and she said, then she said Joe came up on the porch.
         And he said, "Mama, I'm home."
      
      
         Where had he been?
      
      
         He said that they had gone up North.
         They had wound up starting out to New York to visit some relatives of this, this cousin, and they just stayed and he didn't know how to get back, so he just stayed with them.
         He didn't know how to get in touch with them, and he said, you know, you know, as he grew up, you know, he kept thinking about them, and he said he wanted to come back home but he didn't have any way, he didn't have any money.
         And he said finally he know, you know, once he got grown and started working, he saved up his money and he said he was determined to come back and find them, and he didn't even know if they were going to be in the same place\\.
      
      
         Wow.
      
      
         But he said he was going to find them, and he came all the way back.
      
      
         Do you have an idea what year that would be?
      
      
         Oh.
         That would have to have been
         let's see.
         My grandmother was born in 1910, she was a little girl.
         No, she was born in 1900 because she was 16, and so it must have been like in 1926, 19, you know, before, before 1930.
      
      
         Wow.
      
      
         Yeah, yeah, about that, yeah.
      
      
         So he stayed in Augusta after that?
      
      
         Well, I don't know.
         I don't know whether he stayed in Augusta after that.
         Cause they didn't actually live in Augusta, they lived in, well you know, Augusta was still a city-town during that time, even though to people in big cities like this Augusta isn't that big.
         But uh, they lived in a little country town outside of Augusta called Evans, and Evans still exists, and that's where a lot of my relatives still, still are too.
      
      
         Hah.
      
      
         So, ah, and um, Granny, she used to tell a lot of those stories I mean, especially when talking about Augusta being the big city.
         Uh, my grandmother, Granny, her great-grandfather was a white man,
         and one of the, the, the, things that just sticks in her craw is that, and you know, she, she and her sister uh, were lighter than some of the rest of the family.
         Her sister could pass for white, and in fact did pass for white.
         And Granny used to tell the story about how her sister and her sister's husband decided that they were going to move to the city, to Augusta, and pass for white.
         And they moved downtown--
      
      
         So her sister's husband was light-skinned too?
      
      
         Her sister's husband was light-skinned too.
         And, uh, they moved downtown and, there was, uh, and it's still like this in Augusta, this big street downtown called Broad Street, and it really was just this broad street in a downtown area.
         And they found this house or this apartment building or whatever it was that they could live in, and it was right on the edge of Broad Street.
         And, uh, they kind of actually stopped visiting the family because they were just, just determined that they were going to be white.
         They just didn't like what it was like being black in those days, and that was, you know, I guess, that, that was probably, you know, in the early 1930s, uh, when they did that.
         And they,
         they wanted to sever relationships with the rest of the family, but the rest of the family didn't want to sever relationships with them, even though they were mad at them because they had decided, you know, to do something they didn't think was right.
         My, my grandmother was very adamant about, you know, people who try to be things that they aren't, and this, whenever she'd tell this story she'd talk about people who try to be things that they aren't.
         I mean that was the whole point.
         That was the lesson in the story, people who try to be things that they aren't.
         That they shouldn't do that, that you should accept your lot in life, although you should work to improve it, you know, you should be who you are and not try to be something else.
         Um, but she used to visit her sister, ah, in, in, in Augusta, and, but she used to have to go in the back door and pretend she was the maid.
         Granny hated that!
      
      
         I bet.
      
      
         She hated that, and she used to tell her sister every day, she said that, that "You are doing wrong.
         You are doing wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, treating your family this way."
         And so finally, somebody apparently told, that these people were passing for white, and Granny came to visit them at their house, and they were gone, because they had to get out of town really quickly.
         And they couldn't stay in the Augusta area because people knew that they had tried to do something that was really taboo and try to pass for white.
         Um, and so they just left town, and she, she never did see her sister again, never saw her sister again.
      
      
         Wow!
      
      
         So it was just really interesting.
         And you know, the one thing that my, my grandmother, my grandmother, she was so funny about this uh,
         she uh, she treated the children, I mean her, her, her grandchildren, differently based on the color of their skin.
         But she treated the ones like us who were darker, better--
      
      
         Huh.
      
      
         Than the ones who were lighter.
         And actually when we, we kind of began to understand what was going on because my cousins were a little lighter, well they were somewhat lighter than we were, and she would not treat them well and we couldn't figure it out, what, what was going on, you know, why you know, we could get anything we wanted and she was very stern with them.
         And, uh, my mother eventually told us, you know, "Well, she has this thing
         uh and you know just really, and part of it has to do with her family, and the fact that people, you know, uh, when her sister tried to, you know, pass for white and thought she was better than everybody else and she kind of she thinks people who tried to pass for white think they're better than everybody else, and light people think they're better than everybody else."
         And the fact is she was light!
         And that was the thing, that was the thing that was so funny.
         She was a light-skinned black person.
         And it was like she was rejecting who she was, in some ways, by, you know, the way she treated you know, the other grandchildren.
         Um, but you know there were just a lot of mixed feelings involved, and she had to deal with her feelings in her own, but when I got older, when I got to be an adult I actually talked to her about it.
         I told her, "Granny, you know, you are so sweet to us but you are wrong about this, you shouldn't be treating people differently because of that."
         
      
      
         What did she say?
      
      
         And, she said at first--
      
      
         Did she really, kind of, know she was doing it?
      
      
         Yes she did.
         Um, and she said, she said, she said, "Baby," she said, "You don't understand about life the way I understand about life."
         But as she got older, um, she never acknowledged that she was wrong but she did change her behavior.
         So--
      
      
         Now this was the one who married at 16 and didn't--
      
      
         Yeah, yeah, married my grandfather who, who, she was light and he was dark, and I don't know whether that was the reason she married him, although it was kind of like one of those arranged marriages--
      
      
         Ah.
      
      
         Where he was a
         , he was a minister's son, so he had, they had property, and stuff, and they were very well-connected in the community and very, held in high esteem.
         His father was like, uh, the guy who had been pastor of this big church for a long period of time and, and, and so I think her family, the Tates, really wanted to connect with the Keenes for that reason, and so they just really just told her she was going to be marrying him.
         And, she didn't really understand.
         She didn't even understand the marriage ceremony, she didn't even know that she had gotten married, really--
      
      
         Wow!
      
      
         And so when they told her she had to go home with this guy, she said, "Go home with him?
         
         He's old enough to be my daddy."
         
         Well, he was almost, old enough to be her daddy.
      
      
         Oh, no.
      
      
         And he was, my grandfather was not a nice man.
         He was nice enough to us.
         My sister keeps telling me, she says, "Sometimes you're just like Granny, you treat people wrong for the wrong reasons."
         
         And I did because I thought he treated, I thought he treated, uh, my mother and some of the siblings not well in the family, because he had pets, and that all sort of thing, not based on color of skin or anything but just based on, I don't know, on whatever anyway.
         My, my mother wound up not being one of his favorites early on and, ah, so she was relegated to working in the fields whereas some of the other kids didn't work in the fields.
         I mean they only had, like, they had five children, one of them died.
         But they were divided about like who were the field hands and who were the house kids, it was kind of--
      
      
         Really?
      
      
         Yeah, it was almost like a plantation system--
      
      
         That's interesting.
      
      
         Yeah, it was operating within the family--
      
      
         He would have been born--
      
      
         He was born in 1880 something, like 188, I think it was 1889, I think it was when he was born.
         No it was, no he was older than that because my grandmother was born in 1900 and he was born 16 years earlier--
      
      
         1884?
      
      
         1884, yeah.
      
      
         Hum.
      
      
         But he was, you know, in a lot of ways, just like
         a plantation owner's son because he was the son of this guy who owned a lot of property.
         \\
      
      
         He had property.
         \\
      
      
         And it was, he never really had to do anything for himself.
         And he was a philanderer, an d oh yeah, he was like out there
         .
         And, ah, so, you know, I didn't like him, but anyway those are my stories.
      
      
         That's interesting.
      
      
         There are many stories in the naked city
         .
      
      
         You'd be surprised.
      
      
         All right.
      
      
         Thank you.
      
      
         You're very welcome.
      
   

   
   
      
         Uh, I'm nervous.
      
      
         OK.
      
      
         OK, can you hear me?
      
      
         Yeah.
      
      
         OK, OK.
         The story I shall talk about today
      is about my father and the culture diversities he had when he moved to America.
         He is from Greece and he is from a small village in Greece called Tokalleka and he came to America and I believe it was 1969 or 1970 and he shortly got married.
         And they moved to Mallard Creek in Charlotte.
         
         Uh the problem he had with coming to America I guess was
      was that uh, he uh, he wanted to still have the village aspects where he wanted to the farm and all those stuff living in a suburb in Mallard Creek area.
         And this was probably about, uh, 20 years ago or maybe 15 years ago when the area was not so, I guess, rich as it is now.
         It was still cultural area but suburbs was still the dominant form.
         So he, we lived in this area.
         We were houses apart from people.
         Um, he gathered all these animals, goats, horse, chickens, and goat, and he just had so many animals
      .
         And the problem was that animals didn't like to stay at the house they wanted to go around to other people's houses, you know, eat their flowers and stuff and plants.
         We lived off, um, 85 in Mallard Creek where currently the 485 is now cause then the like last ten years we had to move because of the 485.
         The DOT had to buy the property and stuff.
         But anyway, the animals would get loose all the time, especially the goats.
         They didn't want to stay captive.
         They would go, you know, just go out of the fence.
         A lot of times they would get their horns and stuff caught into the, um, fences because there were square fences that my father himself put up all around the property but they would get their horns and stuff, and they would jump over the fence very easily so they would be on the side of the highway and at least 4 or 5 times that I can remember the police would have to come and say, you know, "You have to get your animals."
         And our father always told us not to say they are animals.
         So
      , and I thought this was really crazy because who else in the neighborhood had goats and chickens and stuff and so but he was convinced that they could not prove that those were our goats so but it was very embarrassing as a child living in Mallard Creek because people, everybody knew when you rode a school bus, um, we didn't have the yard with the flowers and stuff.
         We had the goats out there and often our animals would get loose and we had to go out and follow our cow home or something like that, or the, um, animal control would come out to like subdue a cow if it would get too far away so that's really the story I have today, um
      it was just really a awkward experience with him and his animals.
         Other thing that he did with animals was in Greece in his culture a goat is really an important meat; kind of a delicacy, and he even ended up selling goats from this suburb area and the Greek people would come out, pick out their goat, which was really sad for my brother and I because we as children, you know, goats were our friends and pets stuff, and they would come out and pick out their goat and then they would proceed to kill it on property
      and it was really horrible for us as children it was traumatizing.
         
         To see your little pet or friend, you know, have to be killed, skinned, and then they would cut it up and put out their parts there and then they would go off to their restaurant, to their dinner or wedding, or whatever, and eat the goat.
         So that's about it.
         He has a lot of pride in his animals.
         And unfortunately we moved again.
         When DOT took his property, we moved to a smaller, smaller area in Concord where you are not allowed to have animals because it's zoned and so that's the end of the animal story.
         That enough?
      
      
         OK thank you.
         
      
   

   
   
      
         This is Chief Master Sergeant Clem Francis, retired from the US Air Force.
         Today he is going to talk to us about the Third SS, the U2 Quick and the Blackbird.
         Go ahead Mr. Francis.
      
      
         I'm uh, Chief Master Sergeant, retired, as Rick said.
         Uh, I spent much of my time in, uh, Special Activities.
         That's kind of unique in that I, uh, spent, uh, about 16 years of my career in Special Activities.
         I don't want to go into the Third SS that's Third Strategic Support Squadron.
         Way back in, uh, 19 and 60, 19 and 52, when I returned from the, uh, Korea, I was assigned to, uh, a unit, which was called C124 Third Strategic Support Squadron, and, uh, one of their primary purposes was to, uh, uh, move atomic weapons to forward locations.
         And, uh, one of my jobs at the time was training individuals how to put parachutes on a nuclear weapons trigger to, uh, which detonates the atomic bomb itself.
         But my job was to put parachutes on it and life preservers when we would load it and start to an overseas location.
         I would, uh, put parachutes on the trigger itself, and we use that if, in case we had to throw the trigger out over land when we was approaching water, we had to put four life preservers on what they call "Mae West" on the trigger, so we just threw it out over water.
         That was the primary thing we wanted to save
         since there wasn't any way to dump a 20-megaton H-bomb off a 30, a C124.
         If you started to run it back to the elevator, why it would turn the aircraft upside down, so it would if we had trouble the, the bomb itself would end with the aircraft, of course.
         The rest of us after, uh, after we got the trigger out, why we, uh, would bale out of the aircraft, regardless whether if it was water, over land, air or what, but the bottom did go in.
         I want to say that there wasn't any danger of going in with the bomb because it would not explode, regardless of how hard it hit the ground.
         Even if the aircraft was on fire, why it, it would uh, burn and it would melt through a lead component for the radiation to leak out.
         It would not explode without the trigger.
         But anyway, uh,
         I had a top secret clearance in that, so in 19 and 57 why, uh, they started, uh, I didn't know why they was a running the clearance on me to begin because I thought uh, top secret was the highest you could go in security clearance, and, of course, that I knew, everybody in my neighborhood was asking me, "Well what if they're asking about you?"
         And even uh, uh, a neighbor in Earl, NC told me that they was a checking with him on why, uh, uh, on why, uh, they was running a clearance on me.
         I didn't know anything about it until about the time, well, uh, I knew about it when they was running the clearance on me when I had a top secret, so I didn't know anything about what it was all about until I arrived.
         I got orders to go to Del Rio, TX, so when I arrived out there, well, I found out I had to go to Laughlin Air Force Base.
         I was reporting to a certain place in Del Rio, then I had to go to Laughlin Air Force Base, which had just re-opened.
         It wasn't nothing but a desert; there was sagebrush out on the runway.
         Anyway, it was pretty soon after I arrived there, there was, some RV57 ( ) arrived, which used crasher suits as a high altitude photography plane, well, I figured that's what it was.
         I had to start training in course.
         I had already been to partial pressure suit school in my career field, where I was ( ), so I started training with equipment I had never handled before.
         I didn't know what it was all about or anything till I had to go out and train hook in a ( ) in a RV57D, which I say now I found it, it was a forerunner to your U2 aircraft.
         But at the time I arrived there, we didn't have any U2's.
         We didn't know what a U2 was and nobody knew anything about a U2.
         But all of a sudden, we was called out to look at what was flying.
         Well they looked like two big gliders flying over the base and they made a circle and come in and landed and I didn't know whether it was a glider or what it was I hadn't heard the name U2 when I first arrived.
         Come to find out it was a U2 aircraft but we couldn't, we could not say one word about what it was; nothing to our wives, kids or anybody.
         OK, well, I started the training in the U2 with the pressure suits and everything and uh, I don't know how long it was I suited and unsuited the pilots and just practiced putting them in the aircraft.
         Well it got to where there's two or three aircraft arrive in a week and I didn't know where they're flying to.
         All we done, they never did tell us any place where they was going, even when they left the base to go to somewhere else to stay for a while.
         We didn't know where they were going.
         Anyway it got up to, we had about uh, ah, I don't remember the numbers.
         It's 30 or 40 U2 aircraft, and we'd started the training Chinese pilots, British pilots in them, just all over the, the world that we were allies with.
         Uh, but one of the things that I am proud of in the U2's I was the life support man ( ) uh.
         Of course, parachutes and life rafts packed the survival kits, but the U2 kits had what they call a F124 hundred regulator in them which was a highly cued regulator to give the pilots breathing pressure and counter pressure in their capstans of the partial pressure suits in case they had a decompression at high altitudes like 60, 80 thousand feet.
         You know, you can't, you cannot survive if you don't have any counter pressure, increase breathing pressure in those altitudes.
         If, if your hand was exposed outside of the pressure suit, your hands would go to about five times the size, if you had a decompression.
         Well of, of course, needless to say, we had a, we could not make a mistake.
         So, uh, I skip a lot of things here that I could say, but they chose me and one more guy.
         That, I was the only 922 which was life support man the other man was a physiological support.
         Physiological support differs from life support in that he handles the altitude chambers which run pilots up to 80 thousand feet in high altitude chambers, and brings him back down.
         They have to go through a number of altitude chambers, uh, rides before they start even flying U2's or flying with pressure suits.
         Of course they already had done the pilot's bit before they done, well, I had to go through altitude chambers myself because I was working with pressure suits.
         I went to Fort Worth, TX to go through the altitude chambers with a partial pressure just like I was working with, and when, when all the training was done on the pressure suits and things, I was chosen with a sergeant secretary to go through a school, which, we was in a school about the size of a nice-size bathroom.
         We would go in there.
         The doors were locked when we went in.
         Michael Santo of, of Firewell and Company, of Buffalo, NY, they was the one that uh, manufactured, uh, invented the high O2 regulator before that they built fire control on the stove well.
         Anyway, they come up with this invention of the high O2 regulator.
         Say it was a tremendous breakthrough for Firewell and Company.
         Well Mike Santo would start training us in this small room with F24 hundred regulator with we had to tear it down and break it, break it down so many times, and, uh, we had to, uh, set injections on it.
         It's a little screw which set an injection but the, the breathing pressure tube to the pilot and counter pressure.
         Each pilot has a different breathing capacity and we would have to, uh, uh, bend then individual over in the pressure suit uh, uh, I'd have to have to set it for, uh, a second, or which was going through school.
         Then he'd dress me, and, uh, he'd set the injection on me and you, uh, uh, we'd have to bend down and come up with the regulator in the seat kit itself then we'd come up breathing as hard as we could, and you better if uh, the, the, the top portion of your helmet surged, which you had rubber around the neck and the visor closed.
         And, uh, if it surged and just kept surging it would go 'whish,' and, like it was going to pull your head off.
         You'd better get the little screw turned down a little bit because you could damage and individual's lungs very easily.
         And, well, anyway, needless to say, I had to tear down the regulator and put it back together blindfold.
         I never did see, and don't know yet why, unless it was just ex, ex, expressing the, the, the need to know what you was a doing and whatever.
         The part was, there was 158 parts to it and we had to break it down put it back together break it down and never make a mistake.
         Well, I had taken me about 45 days ( ), and I, both to get through the school, and my wife will tell you today that I turned gray-headed within those 45 days, and not real gray but I did turn gray headed.
         And, uh, but, uh, I would think, at night I couldn't sleep.
         I would think, "Well, I'm, I'm going to let somebody else go," but then I would think, "My God!
         They've, they chosen me over about 15 individuals there, to go to through that school and I'm not, I'm not.
         So I would go back determined, determined to stay with it, and, of course, they trained two more after I had been through, but who did they use to set all the injections?
         And it was myself and Secretary, the one who went through that school, that, you know, the two that we went.
         One more thing, uh, ( ) while we were in the school, and Mike Santo was teaching us, we could, uh, take notes, but before we left out of the room Mike would take and tear every one of the notes up that we had and get it down to where you'd rub a pencil over it where you could not read.
         He would tear the, the paper up and put it in the sand, ashtray sand, set it on a fire and burn it, and then stir the ashes up like that.
         Now that's how classified it was.
         And so, well, anyway, uh, they chose me.
         Also, oh, let me go through this.
         About, uh, less than two months after uh, uh, we finished the school and was set the injections on pilots for about two months, Firewell and Company come up with an automatic, fool-proof uh, uh, that uh, the regulator adjusted itself with a little valve that moved back and forth.
         It would not burst the lungs, it would not over inflate it, it was so perfect that you needn't even have to open the kit to set the injection.
         It was uh, automatic.
         OK, well, that's where I went.
         They chose me over everybody else, and, of course Sergeant Secretary, he was a different AFC, but he's the one that went through school with, they chose me to go out of the uh, uh, the organization that I was at on the present.
         Now it's on the same base, but they've set, taken me to field maintenance to run regulators in the ( ) altitude chambers.
         You had to run them every so often, every 60 days, I believe it was, had to make sure that they was, uh, reading exact pressure like at, uh, eight or 20,000 feet, 30,000, 40, 50, 60, 70,000 feet and you had to record it.
         If it was off one iota, you had to do some adjusting to the regulator itself.
         And I thought that was a privilege, and it's still, it's still, I was the only nine two-two Ex-O which was my AFFC Air Force Career field.
         Uh, I was still the one and only nine two-two that had ever set the injection on the regulator.
         I was the only one that uh, ever run the regulators for the, the test in the miniature altitude chambers.
         I'm proud of that.
         So anyway, I worked with the 4080th until 19 and 60, late 1962, well 1963, before I left the 4080th, and I have some things here.
         Well, if I can find the picture of the ().
         Just give me a minute if you want to cut it off, I'd, uh, go.
         Uh, well, of course, you know, () was shot down over Russia in 19 and 60, and then we come with the Cuban Crisis.
         It was, uh, which we, uh, had Rudolph Anderson in a, a formulation of three U2's.
         It was from a airbase that flew over Cuba, and of course Rudolph Anderson was shot down.
         He was the only casualty of the Cuban Crisis, and uh, Kaiser uh, he got the pictures and flew straight to Andrews Air Force in Washington.
         The CIA unloaded the, the film, taken them to the United Nations the next day.
         And uh, Adlai Stevenson, which was United Nation's, uh, uh, Ambassador to US, US, he sit and told Androv Gromikov, of Russia, that he would sit there until hell froze over, unless he had admitted to having the missiles installed in Cuba; offensive missiles headed for the United States, targeted for the United States.
         And, of course, Androv Gromikov didn't answer anything, but we had all the information from the films the U2 had taken.
         Well, the next day, of course, President Kennedy, uh, blockaded Cuba, and, uh, our ships stopped a Russian ship that was headed just outside of Cuba within, and they found missiles on them.
         Well if, uh, I think this is official history.
         If they would have kept moving with that ship towards Cuba, it's my understanding that, uh, we come within six minutes of nuclear war because President Kennedy would have launched the missiles uh, on Russia.
         But anyway, Nikita Khrushchev backed down, turned all of his ships around, and headed back to Russia.
         Of course we were, this is picture of me, now I was at home, stationed.
         And I had put uh, five detachments out of U2's.
         Now I uh, uh, worked with life support, I had to stay there and keep extra gear, extra pressure suits, extra kits, extra parachutes--everything that if I had to in an emergency, that would we'd send these this equipment out to one of those attachments and, and that's what I did.
         And, of course, uh, this is an outstanding job that uh, General ( ) that uh, he was a colonel at that time, gave me an award for doing that outstanding job, and also this is the same Colonel, Colonel ( ) that uh, with President Kennedy giving our unit the outstanding unit award, and until today, I've got it all here in the, in the papers that until today, the 4080th Strategic Reconnaissance Wing of the U2's, that I was in at that time, is the highest, uh, unit in peace time there are.
         That still stands today.
         Uh, of course, I won't go but we, I have just so much I could talk about, but, uh, that is the main things that we, of course, everybody knows now that the, what has happened.
         Uh, Russia backed down and that's the good thing to do because if they did not and we went to nuclear war, I was trying to get my family out of Del Rio and back to NC, but it happened so fast I didn't get them back.
         Because if their was a nuclear war then, or if there's nuclear bombs started missiles or anything, I would want the first one to hit me right between the running lights because this just would be a world after a nuclear war and--.
         So, well I, uh, anyway, uh, uh, this is the three, uh, U2 pilots that, uh, President Kennedy's office in Washington with General May.
         President Kennedy says to the pilots, says, "Gentlemen you take good pictures."
         This is the one that went over Cuba and got the pictures they showed in the United Nations and of Rudolph Anderson was shot down, uh, during the flight.
         He didn't get to go.
         That's all.
         And this is a picture of Colonel ( ) with some of his officers.
         And, and we were, uh, the 48th Extension Reconnaissance Wing, this was after the Cuban crisis, was a voted by the TX legislature that all the members of the 48th Extension Reconnaissance Wing was, uh, the TX Ambassadors.
         This was the first time that, that had happened in 75 years, that TX legislature had voted a military unit being TX Ambassadors, so, needed TX Ambassadors.
         
         Late 1962, uh, I got orders to go to Washington, D.C. I didn't know what I was going for or anything, so was to report to a designated place in Washington.
         Uh, I went ahead up and it was highly classified, even my orders were classified.
         So I went to, I went to Washington D.C. and I didn't go directly to, uh, that, uh, they had told me to on my orders.
         I went to my sister's that lived there .
         Her husband was in the service and worked with Intelligence, and I went to their house.
         They lived just in MD just outside of the beltway, Washington D.C. So I went to her house and then I called in to this number I was supposed to call when I got there.
         And I called in and they asked me where I was at.
         I told them my sister's.
         They asked a few questions and I answered them and they said, "Get your baggage and leave there immediately, and come to the address you were supposed to when you arrived in Washington."
         I go ahead and picked the baggage and went to the address I was supposed to.
         Of course, they questioned me there, why I went.
         "Well they, they live there, and I, uh, needed a place to stay."
         They said, "We're paying for a place for you to stay.
         You don't have to stay there."
         Well after they checked, they asked me about her husband.
         After they checked, found out he was in security service with the Air Force, they said, "OK," I could go ahead back and stay there if I wanted and they gave me a certain time to report to the CIA Headquarters, which I can say that name, and needless to say, I was up there for a week and I, I can't say anything else what happened or anything.
         But I didn't know what in God's world I was there for.
         I, I just didn't I was just puzzled.
         Of course I came back, after a week, to Laughlin Air Force base, and then shortly thereafter I got orders I could bring my family and everything to Las Vegas, NV and I couldn't tell my wife or anything about why I was going there because I didn't know.
         And so, we moved to Las Vegas, NV, and I reported, just like I did in Washington, to a certain address in downtown Las Vegas.
         They told me that, uh, that I would be called in a guy at the end for me to meet.
         It was another GI and said I would go with him on Monday morning to a certain location, and we never was for many, many years, we could not even mention the location, but now I have the declassification of it, Roadrunner's International right there in it's authorized, and it tells all about the A-12 Blackbird crew that I was going to in early 1963 and I guess it was the most classified thing that there was at that time in the United States but when I got out and gone out found out what was going into and I looked at one of those birds, there was actually bile come into my mouth.
         Now that's how, uh, I stay buckled in.
         We had full pressure suits there in the aircraft just, just like the astronauts wore, except ours was totally silver, silver uh, boot and everything, to reflect heat, of course.
         I started immediately, uh, uh, training into that from the other two guys that was at the location.
         They had already had their training in the full pressure suits and it taken me a while if you go into full pressure suits.
         Different, totally different types parachutes and in an bird that flies, uh, three times the speed of sound, over 22,000 miles an hour.
         You can't even imagine that and I really can't get over, as, as many pilots that I put in that aircraft, and know, and seen them come in ( ) and go walk up the plank to, to get him out of the aircraft and he waits for me to get him out.
         And then he looks.
         When I pull, when he pulls the canopy for me to start getting him out, he points to two instruments on the left side of the aircraft that had actually melted during the flight.
         And one of our jobs was to measure, uh, heat on the top of their helmet, which was a piece to tape that went across there and put out by NASA that, uh, there was different spots of paint on it.
         And the spots of paint would change every hundred degrees, it might be red, it change to blue.
         Where, I didn't know what the code was, but, of course, I'd take it and turn it in to individuals back at life support but I know that I have measured them and they told me he had 300 degrees on the top of his head.
         But you have to remember, he had a tremendous cooling system going in to his full pressure suit and going out to the inside of his hands channels and then down to his feet he's got channels pumping cold air down there all the time and then comes back and exhausts out the outside of the control.
         There's so much you could talk about on that I'll just skip that.
         But uh, think about it.
         You're putting a man in there it's risking his life, those tests like what we had Lockheed Aircraft individuals.
         Test pilots that flew them first, like Lou ( ), I could name all of them really, but they test the birds first, and then our CIA pilots started flying them.
         We were the ones handled, our CIA pilots, uh, anyway, uh, we set all kinds of records step by step.
         Only lost two, three aircraft while we was there, and, uh, test phase.
         But we only lost one CIA pilot there and really why, uh, there's a modification that we shouldn't have made.
         You live and learn, you know, when you test, uh, aircraft.
         Uh, well it's, uh, the speeds got faster, faster, and faster until we deployed overseas.
         In the meantime the Air Force bought the SR71, now the A-12, that we were working with the CIA.
         It was one space aircraft, one-man aircraft he operated all the cameras and everything and flew the aircraft.
         The SR71 was a two space aircraft which you had a pilot and a systems operator in the back seat give the pilot a little bit of a break from what the A-12 CIA version of the plane had.
         Anyway, we deployed and I can tell now be, because of this that, that, that, uh, we deployed to Kadina, Okinawa, and this was in 1968.
         And I will tell you about one flight that we made over there that I hooked up.
         One individual Mr. Weeks had his name here on page six, and he made the flight over up to the edge of China, over North Korea extreme north, back over the middle and back down south.
         Got the pictures of the Pueblo, when the North Koreans captured the Pueblo and brought it in to North Korea.
         I don't know if you remembered it or not or ever thought about it.
         Well, we got the pictures of that and, and even got the pictures of a Russian officer walking on the gangplank.
         Why this was the next day.
         Why I remember it so is that I was the individual that put Mr.Weeks in the aircraft and, and sent him out on his mission and made a successful mission.
         And, uh, one bad thing though, coming back down below South Korea between there and Japan, our battleships launched their vehicles and started firing.
         They see, uh, we flew on radio silence.
         All of our pilots flew on radio silence, period.
         And, of course, they were going so fast they couldn't move up and down but evidently they got, uh, word back real quickly by mashing the scrambler, a button on the inside of the aircraft.
         I don't know that; I never was told that, but CIA got the word quick like that, but they never could shoot him down anyway, and they have never, never.
         They've had so many thousands and they never been shot down yet.
         I stayed with them until 19 and 69 before I left there.
         And uh, course I won't go into anything else because I'm not prepared with my information here, but thank you very much.
      
   

   
   
      
         This story, it's uh, it's, happened about two years ago and, uh, uh, my wife, Elizabeth, I have a son, Jack, who's ten years old, a son, Nick, who's eight, and, uh, Alex, who's five.
         And we're trying to make a decision whether to buy a beach place, beach house, or a lake house, or a mountain house.
         And we'd read this newspaper on a Sunday morning, you know, you get these articles about um,
         you know, advertisements about these beautiful mountain, mountain lake places and we thought, "Gosh, this is great, you know, it's a combination of both, it's a, it's a, a mountain place with this beautiful lake, that surrounds this, this mountain."
         So, um, we called, and, uh, this guy answered the phone, and he's with the development company, it's up in the mountains, it's near, uh, uh, Lake Lure.
         And, uh, the guy says, "Come on up," and he says, "Wha, what will you be driving?"
         and, uh, we said, "Well, a, a car or a van, you know."
         "Do you, is the van four-wheel drive?"
         and I said, "Well, no, it's not," and he says, "Well, you know, some of this gets real rugged, you know, up here, and, uh, it's not fully developed, the you know you can look at some of the lots, if you bring your van, you can just look at some of the lots that are developed you know, so it'll be, you can drive right up to it."
         So, um, we thought about that and we thought, "Well, let's just take the truck, because I have a four-wheel drive truck, it's got the king cab, and we put all the kids in the back, smashed them in that little king cab part and got in the truck and drove.
         And we drove about two hours, and it was getting pretty hot, you know, kind of, kind of a miserable ride, and we get up, and, uh, get up to Lake Lure into this development, pull into the development; you have to drive, like, meandering through this, this hillside, and we get up to this trailer and, uh, we thought, "Well, this is," you know, we thought, "Well, we'd be able to see houses," and, uh, you know, you could tell this development was not that far along.
         So we talked to the development guy, and he, he kind of shows us a map, a real rough map of the area, and uh, so tells us, "Well, you know, here, here are the key, key kind of sites, and you're looking for what?"
         And we said, "Well, we want a, a house that's kind of in the mountains and that looks on a lake like you had in the newspaper."
         And he goes, "Well, we got, we got SOME of those," and I said, "Well, in the newspaper it says you have all your houses are overlooking lakes" and he goes, "Well," you know, and he could tell we had driven a long way just to, you know, you know, just to see some really kind of rugged area, and we, he knew exactly what we wanted at that point.
         He says, "Well, here's, there's one lot left that actually overlooks this water, and it's on a hilltop," and uh, you know, kind of drew it out on this paper map and then we drove out there.
         Well, we start driving in this truck, you know, I have a fairly large truck, and we're driving, and the road's at first paved, and then we're driving along, and then it goes to stone, gravel, and then, pretty much, we keep going, and it's like dirt, turns into a dirt road, and then, at the end of this road, probably the last twenty minutes, we're driving over tree stumps
         , to get to this location on this map.
         And, uh, we finally get up there.
         It took us twenty minutes, of rough driving, in four-wheel drive, to get to the top of this hill.
         And we get, get there, and we literally had to park between trees that they'd just cut.
         And, uh, they'd just clear-cut; I don't know if you know, ever heard what clear cutting is.
         Clear cutting is, you cut the trees down, but you leave the trees there, then you bring a bulldozer and push them off later.
         Well they hadn't pushed any of these off, so there's these trees on top of this hill.
         And I kind of drove to the peak of this hill, and we could see down on the lake, and it was kind of neat, but the, the, the lake, the hill, the grade down to the lake was just unbelievable, it was almost like a cliff.
         And you know, you could it was probably an eight per cent grade very steep grade.
         So, Elizabeth--
      
      
         Like what degree?
         More than for, less than forty-five degrees, I mean?
      
      
         It was about, uh, probably thirty degrees, so pretty steep.
         And Elizabeth, ah, immediately she looks at me, and she goes, "You keep these boys here, you know, we'll stay, and we'll kind of look around, but, you know, um, just you keep track of these guys."
         Well, Alex, the youngest, of course he's just so sick of being in this truck, he says, "Get me out of here," you know, just, "Let me out!"
         I say, "OK, everybody, we're going to get out of the truck, we're going to kind of look around, we'll do some stuff, and then, we'll probably eat breakfast, and then we'll go or, ea, we had our little bag lunches, and then we'll go down to the lake.
         And, uh, we get out of the truck, and we walk about ten feet, and I, I was like, walking over logs and trying to get over to a fairly clear area, and all of a sudden, Alex just goes, "Snake!
         Snake!"
         screaming at the top of his lungs, you know, and it, it just, it was unbelievable how loud he was yelling, how, and I thought, "Oh, my God, he got bit by a snake."
         Well I turn around and I go, "Wha, what's wrong?
         !" and Alex is pointing at me, and I look down between my legs, and there's this rattlesnake, like I'd stepped in this rattlesnake nest!
         And I'm standing there
         and I go, "OK, everybody just calm down," and, you know.
         And I stepped down on the log, and then Ja, Alex is freaking out, just freaking out, he's going, "Jees, Dad, Jees!"
         you know, my go, my son's cussing like I do, you know, I was so scared!
         So we walk, we walk away from that snake, I go, "Oh my God, I'm lucky I'm not dead, you know, they could have bit me and then you guys would have put me in a truck and hauled me twenty minutes and I, I, you know, I probably would have died."
         And I, I'm like, God, somebody's trying to tell me something.
         So anyway, we kind of, we stayed away from the snake and we're kind of walking around, and then, Jack and Nick, they, Jack's the oldest, and Nick, you know, is eight, and, uh, they want to go down to the lake, and Elizabeth's going, "No, don't let them go down to the lake, just, it's too steep, don't let them go down to the lake."
         And, uh,
         we, you know, they're just saying, "Well what are we doing?
         We're just going to get in the truck and then go back?
         Let's just at least look at the lake."
         So I said, "OK, guys.
         You guys can go, go down to the lake, just be careful."
         And, uh, so they kind of walked over to the hill, kind of started walking down, and at a point they just had to sit on their butts and kind of slide down, and the trees were all cut, so they'd grab trees as they were going down.
         And, um, I was just watching them, and I was up at the top, and then, I started down, I'd figured, let them go first, then I'd, I'd go kind of behind them.
         I was probably, um, I'd say sixty foot behind them.
         And, um, Nick was first, Jack was in the middle, I was at the back.
      
      
         And Alex was with Elizabeth?
      
      
         And Alice, Alex stayed with Elizabeth, and she was mad at us, because we were doing this.
         She's up at the top of the hill.
         And, um, I said, "Nick, everything OK?"
         you know, he says, "Yeah, yeah."
         All of a sudden, Nick, and we still, to this day, do not know why he did this, he stood up, on this grade, and started
         running down this hill.
         I mean, the hill's, no human being could catch
         that kind of momentum without gravity pulling him down, and he starts running, and he's running, and you could just see, it was like, there's no way he's going to recover from this.
         And he's running, trying to keep up with gravity, so he's going down this hill, and literally, falling down the hill, but instead of falling down, he's running!
         And, what we didn't know, was this hill came down, and then there was a twenty foot cliff, with a big terrace in it, and then the hill kept going.
         They'd cut a terrace into the hill, halfway down it, you couldn't see it from the top, where they drove trucks down, and they'd just clear cut this, and down at that cliff, the bottom of that cliff was twenty foot in the air, literally, higher than this ceiling, and down at the bottom were just these little like bungee, where they'd cut all this brush and there's little bungee stuff sticking out.
         And all of a sudden I just saw Nick just run, and disappear off this cliff, and he's just flying, like the last thing I saw was him flying.
         I go, "Oh, my God."
         By that time, I'm running down the hill, just grabbing stuff, like falling down the hill, grabbing stuff.
         And as I saw he hit the ground, flat, like on those bungees, and then flipped two times.
         He hit flat, face first, flipped three times, I mean, end over end, and landed in the, spread eagle, backwards and by the time I came down the cliff, he's just grabbing his eyes, and I looked down, and then I saw those bungees, and I thought, "Oh, my God, he impaled his eyes and his face and his body with these bungee things, uh, oh my God."
         I just flew off the cliff, you know, and by that time I get to him, he's just, he's not even breathing, and I looked at him, I go, "Nick!
         Are you all right?"
         And I looked at his nose and his mouth and his eyelids, and what he'd done, he'd hit the ground, and it was a real dusty, powdery.
         He'd missed all those bungee sticks, but the dust and dirt had gone in his mouth, and like, his nose was filled with dirt, it backed up in here, and under his eyelids were filled with dirt, he was, he goes, he looked at me, and he goes, "Uuuugggghhhh."
         He couldn't talk.
         He says, "Am I alive?
         Am I alive?"
         I go, "Nick, what were you doing?
         What did you think?
         Wha, why, what were you thinking to run down this hill?"
         And he goes, "Well, I started falling and I couldn't stop myself and I figured, I'd rather run down hill as fast as I could, and I thought that I could, I could outrun it, and I saw Bugs Bunny do it on T, on cartoons."
         
         He thought Bugs Bunny could outrun, you know, the speeding locomotive or, and it, I think his whole mind, you know, like when the house is falling and Bugs Bunny hops out at the last minute, and then lives?
         That's what he was thinking, that's, that's science, that's kinetic energy in his mind.
         Bottom line, we got him back up the hill, and one week later, we bought a house at the beach.
         
         No way, somebody was trying to tell us not to do that.
         Snakes, killing our kids, you know, two hours, it's hot; it was the most miserable time.
         And Elizabeth and I still to this day say, "We didn't, we're lucky that we, that two of us aren't dead
         , you know, from trying to buy the mountain house."
         But that's my story.
      
   

   
   
      
         Thanksgiving I was hanging out with my friends on a Friday night, OK, to give you a little background.
         You know, we just went to the movies, or whatever, and then the next night I went to work.
         I was working at a nursing home.
         I was washing dishes and cleaning pots and pans and stuff like that.
         So and then all of a sudden I got this massive fever.
         Which, you know, when you get a fever you don't realize you have a fever at the time, especially when you're that age because you don't know exactly what the symptoms are.
      
      
         Right.
      
      
         But I felt like crap.
         I was aching all over and it just hit me like that.
         Within five or 10 minutes.
         I just felt terrible.
         So then I called my mother to pick me up.
         I had driven there but she had to come pick me up; that's how bad I was.
      
      
         You couldn't drive.
      
      
         I couldn't even drive.
         I was that sick but within a half an hour, I would say that was.
         So she took me home.
         And, uh, while she was taking me home I got this pounding headache.
         I felt like somebody was hitting me in the head with a rubber mallet.
         You know, just a thud like this thud, thud, thud, maybe a little slower than that.
         
         But it hurt.
         So she took me home.
         I went to the doctor, the next day was Sunday morning and I was in bad shape.
         I was terrible.
         I was just like half-conscious, just in a lot of pain.
         Well actually, I was fully conscious but I was just in a lot of pain.
         So I looked really weird.
         So I go into the doctor's office, you know, back in high school days I thought it was cool I had the black leather jacket and all that.
         
         The long hair.
      
      
         Fonzie
      
      
         No, I had long hair, didn't look exactly like Fonzie.
         It was the heavy metal thing.
         Uh, so he asked what drugs I'm on, you know, what I had O.D.'d on?
         Nothing, nothing.
         trying to tell him I was just sick.
         So he examines me, and all that, sends me home with my mother, and he had given her instructions on what to do if anything happened to me.
         So as it turns out something happened to me.
         I, lying in bed I passed out while I was lying in bed I fell out of bed, or something.
         I think my parents heard me hit the floor.
         So they come in, so my father and my sister take me to the hospital.
      
      
         So did the doctor know what was wrong with you?
      
      
         He had an idea what was wrong with me but he didn't want to tell my parents because he didn't want to get them in a total panic.
      
      
         Oh OK.
      
      
         Ah.
         So they take me to the hospital and I bang my head a couple of times on the way there.
         I bang my head on the car door.
         
         I don't remember any of this.
      
      
         No wonder, no wonder you felt like a mallet was hitting you.
         
      
      
         Yes.
         And I don't remember any of this.
         The last thing I remember was, you know, being sick Sunday morning.
         After I got home from the doctor's I don't really remember anything after that.
         So, you know, I hit my head on the car door.
         My sister told me that, at the time, that I let out a huge
         scream which I don't remember.
         And I remember while my mother was driving me around, every time she would hit a bump, you know, that was like the mallet would, ah, increase the pain level about four times.
         It was a fun trip.
      
      
         I'm sure it was a real fun for your family.
      
      
         Yeah, oh it was horrible for them.
         So I wake up three days later.
         And it turns out that I had meningitis.
      
      
         Humph.
      
      
         I almost died during that three days.
         You know, all these things my parents had to call my school and everything and tell them I was in the hospital practically dying.
         So it was actually a lot worse experience for my family because, you know, they had--
      
      
         You were passed out half the time.
      
      
         Right, they had to go through wondering for three days whether or not I was going to live.
         For a couple of days maybe not three days for like a, I guess, maybe like a 24-hour period or what ever.
      
      
         Right, uh-huh.
      
      
         I could have lived or died or I could have had some major damage done to me.
      
      
         Oh really like permanent stuff could happen?
      
      
         Because meningitis effects your, uh, the lining of your nervous system.
      
      
         Oh OK.
      
      
         And your brain, which is called the meningitis, it gets swollen and that is what caused the pain.
         You know, that is like the throbbing pain it's like a swelling or whatever.
         So then all my friends had to get throat cultures because it's very contagious.
      
      
         Oh really.
      
      
         Anybody that I interacted with at school had to get throat cultures.
      
      
         Now where were you working in the beginning when you started washing the dishes in a restaurant?
      
      
         In a nursing home.
      
      
         In a nursing home OK.
      
      
         Right so I was doing dishes.
      
      
         So did they have to test the nursing home people?
      
      
         I'm sure they did yeah.
         And I never worked in a nursing home again after that.
         I kept telling that I was going to come back.
      
      
         They didn't want the Outbreak monkey to come back.
         
      
      
         I kept telling them I was going to come back but then I never did.
         So.
         OK now another family tragedy.
         
         In 1992 my sister, the same sister that drove me to the hospital when I had meningitis with my father, she got cancer in 1992 in 1991 in April of 1991 she was diagnosed a week after my niece was born.
      
      
         Now is that her daughter?
      
      
         Yes.
      
      
         OK so she had a baby and a week later she is diagnosed with cancer.
      
      
         Yeah.
      
      
         Cancer of the what?
      
      
         She had lymphoma.
      
      
         OK.
      
      
         It was throughout her body.
         And the way it happened was she her arm went numb.
         They were examining her and trying to figure why her arm went numb.
         And what they figured out was that it was a tumor so the tumor was pressing against a nerve, which made her arm numb.
      
      
         Oh.
         OK.
      
      
         So but then a year later she died in June of '92 with the cancer.
      
      
         Uh-huh.
      
      
         And so those three weeks before she died was like, you know.
         The whole time was a terrible time.
      
      
         ( ) So as soon as diagnosed it did they pretty much say that "there was not much we can do because it is all over her body".
      
      
         No.
         She went through chemo she went through everything she went through chemo, ah, radiation.
      
      
         Drugs?
      
      
         Yeah you know she fought it the whole time.
         She never thought she was going to die.
      
      
         OK good, good.
      
      
         She never had that idea in her mind I mean like right up to a month or two before she, uh, passed away she was doing math homework, I was helping her with math homework.
         Yeah, she never thought, she never gave up.
      
      
         She was a fighter.
      
      
         Right, basically.
         That's how you can say it.
         She never gave up and, you know, she went through all the treatments, and then, well, then a funny thing relates to that story like, well then the whole story is not funny.
         
         But we had, the two or three weeks before, we wound up, going to the hospital a lot, we knew her time was short.
         And then, every time I wound up driving into Manhattan, you know, we lived on Staten Island, so I was driving into Manhattan, and every time I would park on the street, I would get a parking ticket.
         It was like a guarantee.
         I should have learned.
         I should have just parked in the parking garage, but the parking garages were like anywhere from $14 to $24 a day.
      
      
         How much is a parking ticket?
      
      
         Well I think that a parking ticket at the time was maybe $25 or something like that.
      
      
         So it wasn't that much difference.
      
      
         It wasn't that much difference.
         But it could have been, I mean, some of them were like $50 I think.
         But this is meter parking and, I mean, if you went a minute over you had a ticket.
      
      
         You mean there was someone there waiting for it to go a minute over.
      
      
         Yeah it was like magic.
         Yeah this is how efficient the people were that were giving the tickets out were, uh, so that was fun.
         You know driving into Manhattan getting a ticket.
      
      
         How was it on the family to see, just to know that the end is near.
         I mean because you all live there together in the same basic area right?
      
      
         Right we all, most of us live on Staten Island.
         My sister lives, my other sister lives in New Jersey.
         She was living at the same place at the time, uh, you know, it was sad of course it was also, you know, it was a binding experience my family did become closer after that, you know, because you know united in tragedy I guess you could say.
      
      
         Sure.
      
      
         Ah.
      
      
         Did different people tend to handle it differently?
         How?
      
      
         Oh yes, definitely a wide range of reactions, you know.
         You know, you know, one of my brothers was real upset, you know, ah most of us were pretty mellow like, you know, we weren't really, at the time, we weren't really outwardly trying, you know, we really didn't show a lot of upsetness.
      
      
         Right.
      
      
         Because everybody was trying to show--
      
      
         Trying to help her out.
      
      
         Right and help everybody else out.
      
      
         How long, I mean did the doctor just come and say she has got about six weeks left or one of those kinds of things did, did you know?
         JG: Yes, yes.
      
      
         Pretty much.
      
      
         Well they said in April they said that she had, she had about three months which would be like July towards the end of July, I think.
         But it, uh, turns out she died right in the middle of June so she actually died before the time that they gave her.
      
      
         Uh-huh.
      
      
         They gave her three months, but she only lived about a month and a half.
      
      
         Did she know that?
         Did they tell her directly?
      
      
         Yeah I think they did, um.
      
      
         I just can't imagine someone saying you have three months to live.
      
      
         Well you know, I don't think, did I don't think they did tell her that.
         They told my brother-in-law, you know, whom we are still very close to.
      
      
         Oh that was her husband.
      
      
         Right, yeah.
         He is living in Manhattan now with my two nieces, you know, my family is still very close to them.
         You know I consider him you know just as close as any of any of my other relatives.
      
      
         Sure.
      
      
         My in-laws or whatever.
      
      
         Sure.
      
      
         You know, there was never any, like severance of relations, you know what I mean?
      
      
         Yeah.
      
      
         Um, you know, because of that.
         Anyway so him and my two nieces still live in Manhattan.
      
      
         How old are the little girls now?
      
      
         They're, ah, man.
         Well one is eight, no, well she is nine and the other one is 11.
      
      
         So she never knew her mom, man.
      
      
         Well she was about a year old when my sister died.
         A year and two months old so she really didn't, no she never really go that close to her.
         She only saw her about half that time you know during that period.
         So she was, you know, like we kept her at my house a lot.
         And my other niece she stayed at my father in-law's family a lot.
         Ah, let's see.
         Another funny story was related to that my other niece, the older niece, she was three at the time she still had her pacifier and everything.
         I got to share a room with her this is fun she was a cute as a button.
         But, uh, she would wake up at night sometimes going, "Mimi, Mimi, Mimi."
      
      
         Now is that Mom?
      
      
         No, she had a pacifier she called, ah, "Mimi."
         So her pacifier would fall out of her mouth at night so she would just wake up.
         It would be right next to her she wouldn't just grab it a stick it in her mouth she would go "Mimi, Mimi."
         So I had to get up a put the pacifier in her mouth it was really cute.
      
      
         
         Just so she would go back to sleep.
         
         That is really funny.
      
      
         It was really sweet.
      
      
         Uh, I can't imagine having to tell a three-year-old that mommy has gone to Jesus.
      
      
         Right.
      
      
         Or whatever.
      
      
         Right.
         Well my brother-in-law had that pleasure.
      
      
         Yeah.
      
      
         But, you know, I mean she was upset, but she wasn't, well she was upset.
      
      
         Right.
      
      
         But I don't know if it totally hit her, you know what I mean?
      
      
         If she had been about five or six it probably would have been very different.
      
      
         Right.
         But she would go through stages where she would be upset, you know, like she would realize, I mean she realized what happened, and, of course now she is really aware.
      
      
         Yeah.
      
      
         But at the time, I guess, you know, I guess she would forget, you know, and sometimes she would remember.
      
      
         OK, I see, interesting.
      
      
         I guess, you know, but.
      
      
         Well I think we have got enough.
         Thanks a lot.
      
   

   
   
      
         Just start talking.
         Go!
      
      
         OK, um, let's see.
         I remember when I was probably around nine, ten, eleven, somewhere in there, we used to play outside a lot.
         We used to play kickball a lot.
         We had groups of us that would get together and play kickball every night until it got dark, so dark that we couldn't see, and then we rode our bikes.
         And back then, it was colder in the Charlotte area than it is now, and we would have snow at least once or twice a year, and it wasn't unusual to get a foot of snow.
         And we all had ice skates, so we would ice skate up and down the streets; I remember doing that.
         We missed at least two weeks of school every year for snow and we always had heavy coats and mittens, stuff that you don't have now here.
      
      
         Huh!
      
      
         Yeah!
         And the only place, there were no skating rinks in Charlotte.
         The only place that you, there were no roller skating rinks at all.
         The only place that you could go ice-skating was at the Coliseum.
         And every weekend we would have hockey games and during the day they would, you know, redo the ice and then you could ice skate.
         So that's what we did during the day.
         And, let's see, I used to climb trees.
         Once I climbed a tree, a pine tree, and I got to the top and it started swaying.
         And I was afraid, and I couldn't come down, and so my daddy had to get this really high ladder and come up it and get me down.
         You know about that don't you?
      
      
         Yes.
      
      
         
         Been there, done that!
         Um, let's see, there was, uh, obviously, no VCRs or any of that.
         I remember when color, we had a little black and white TV; that's all anybody had.
         And I remember when color TV came out and I was so excited!
         My parents finally bought a color television and the first thing that we watched in color was Bonanza.
         And I was madly in love with Little Joe.
      
      
         
            
         
      
      
         And I remember running around outside being really, really hot thinking Bonanza would come on at 9:00 on Sundays.
         And we'd come running back in the house to watch it and we'd be all hot and sweaty and dirty and mother would make us sit on the floor and we'd sit there watching Bonanza.
         And let's see, and the other thing that I remember that was my favorite movie was The Wizard of Oz.
         That was my very favorite movie.
         And then let's see, movies, very different from now.
         The only theatres that was in Charlotte was the Manor Theatre on Providence Road and what was called the Carolina Theatre up town.
         That was the only places to go to the movies.
         There were no shopping malls.
         Um, we would ride the buses; a big treat was to ride the bus uptown to go shopping at Ivy's and Belk's.
         And for Christmas they had these elaborate window displays and we would ride the buses uptown on the weekend to look at all the, and walk all through uptown to look at the window displays with all the Christmas decorations.
         That was the big entertainment.
         I remember when Carolina Place Mall was built, that was the first mall.
         Everyone was excited about that.
         Um, we used to go shopping there.
         When I was your age, I worked uptown and, um, there was only two big buildings, First Union building and the Wachovia building and all the rest of it were parking lots.
         So it's, it's changed a little bit.
         
         I can't think of anything else to talk about
         .
         We didn't, um, in Charlotte, back in the 50s and 60s, they didn't have the big orange school buses, and we either walked to school, because everything was neighborhood schools, so in elementary school we always walked to school.
         And there was like a thing where we'd cut through the woods.
         That's to tell how different it was.
         It was totally safe; you never locked your doors.
         We cut through the woods walking to school.
         Um, and then when I got in junior high, we started riding city buses to school.
         I'm not sure how that worked or how the route worked, I just remember doing it.
         And we had sock hops on Saturdays.
         Once a month we'd have a sock hop and we'd walk to that
         , or we'd thumb.
         And the first time I ever went to Myrtle Beach I was 14 years old and it was, we went with a friends of mine.
         Her parents were renting a place and she and I and another one of our girlfriends went.
         And we would go up and down the main drag there at Myrtle Beach where the Pavilion is and we would thumb up and down the, and we would just hop in the car with guys and ride up and down and yell and wave to everybody and then we'd get tired of those guys and we'd hop and go hop out and hop in the car with some more guys.
         
         It was totally safe!
         You never worried about it!
         Um, then all the hippie stuff started in the 60s and that was during Vietnam.
         When I was in, uh, junior high and high school there was big letter writing campaign to all the soldiers in Vietnam a lot of the guys I was in high school with got drafted.
      
      
         Uh-huh.
      
      
         Uh, hmm, I'm running out of things to say again
         .
         I was dating a guy that lived in the apartment beside Steve.
         And Steve would see me going up there to visit him or see us going out and stuff.
         And then, um, a neighbor that lived across the street from me, her husband was a member of the Jump Club; Steve was "jumping" then, and she had a cookout one night, invited some people over, and I went over there and, um, I think I was the youngest one there.
         They were all going out to a club or something and I wasn't old enough to get in, but I went with the rest of them.
         I think I was kind of at the end of the line and I snuck in anyway and Steve thought I was really cute.
         And then he got home and I don't know how he got my phone number.
         He got it from somebody and called me.
         And I wasn't really dating that guy that seriously, so I decided to go out with Steve.
         So I went out with him.
         Then I was dating this other guy.
         And then one of my girlfriends that was living with me at the time, we worked together at First Union, she bet me that I couldn't date a different guy every day for 2 weeks, so I did that.
         
         I thought you'd get a kick out of that one.
         I used to be cute!
      
      
         
            
         
      
      
         Um, anyway, Steve and I dated, I guess, not quite a year, about nine months or so, and then we decided to get married and then he took it back, and then we decided to get married and then he took it back, and then we decided to get married and then he took it back again!
         What else?
         Hmm
         .
         Ask me a question.
      
      
         So did you get married?
      
      
         26 years ago!
         
      
      
         Obviously!
      
      
         Yeah.
         There were no, there were only two night clubs in Charlotte so if you wanted to go out, like to listen to music and dance, there was only two places to go.
         So most everything, the apartment complexes would have parties.
         Like every weekend there would be parties in the clubhouses of the apartment complexes and that was pretty much where you would go to dance and just hang out with your friends.
         Um, things escape me!
         
         Oh!
         When I was in high school the big excitement was cruising Shoney's.
         There were four Shoney's in Charlotte and you would ride from one, it was like a big circle, and you would ride from one to the other and everybody would hang out there because it was a drive-in then, so all the cars were parked outside.
         And you could cruise through to see who was there and if it wasn't any cute guys there or anybody you liked then you would cruise to the next one.
         They were spread out around town so it would take about an hour to drive between all of them.
         And they had the, the Shoney's Big Boy was always sitting out front.
         And that was the big thing for all the guys, was to steal the Shoney's Big Boy and try to get it on top of their car and go riding down the road with it on top of the car.
         Um, once when I was in high school, I spent the night with my girlfriend across the street and we snuck out and pushed her mother's brand new Camero out of the driveway and halfway down the road then we started it.
         And then we went cruising and we had an egg fight with some other guys riding down Independence Blvd.
         We were leaning out the windows throwing eggs at each other and everywhere the eggs hit it knocked the paint off her mother's brand new car.
         So we had to get jobs and earn the money to repaint the car.
         
         I was a little wild.
      
      
         Yeah.
      
      
         Family things.
         All my family's in eastern North Carolina so we went there several times a year to my grandmother's and aunts' and uncles'.
         I had two cousins that were my age.
         And I spent a lot of summers, I spent like a whole month in the summer there with them.
         We, this was at the beach, and we'd go to the beach during the day and the movies or stuff at night.
         The family would come up here.
         The most traumatic thing, my daddy decided to build a house when I was in the 10th grade so, and he literally built the house, and when we moved into it there was no sheet rock on the inside and the plumbing wasn't hooked up yet.
         So we had a garden hose coming in through the kitchen window for our water in the sink in the kitchen.
         We had one toilet in the house that was flushable but since there wasn't any sheet rock around the bathroom we hung these big army blankets to the studs, nailed those to the studs for privacy.
         And all my aunts and uncles and cousins came up to help move in and work on the house.
         So we had a weekend when it was like 12 of us staying there with one toilet, the hose going in through the kitchen
         and piles of dirt and then the porch wasn't finished and we had boards going up to the porch so you had to walk up the boards to get in.
         So I had my dates pick me up at somebody else's house because I was embarrassed for them to come my house.
         
         But I know how to put sheet rock up and do shingles and all of that.
         That's the house my parents are still in.
      
      
         Really?
      
      
         Uh-huh.
      
      
         Neat!
      
      
         Daddy built the whole thing!
      
      
         Wow.
         Well, did you and Linda ever play together?
      
      
         My sister and I didn't like each other growing up; we fought all the time.
         We weren't friends until we were in our 20s.
         There's four and half years difference in our age.
         That's a big difference.
         She was my bratty little kid sister that got in the way and tattled on me.
         I remember when we were both teenagers, she would sneak in and take my clothes and we would fight over that.
         But then once we got, we lived together for a while before Steve and I got married.
         So once we were grown, we were very close.
      
      
         Hmm.
      
      
         Um, my parents didn't have much money.
         Daddy worked for Douglas Aircraft and then they closed up and they didn't want to move so they stayed here and he had, it took him a while before he found jobs.
         He had a gun shop, he tried several different stores, and he had a gun shop.
         He had that on the porch of the house and I used to sit out there and help him load shotgun shells and we used to go target shooting and stuff.
      
      
         
            
         
      
      
         Um, so we just didn't have much money.
         When I was in junior high school, the big thing was, um, alpaca sweaters, A-line skirts, and Pappagalo shoes.
         So I had a little part time job.
         So that all I could afford to do was get the shoes and the sweaters and I made all my skirts and made my blouses.
         And the first time I ever, we, we camped, we would go to the mountains and go camping that was the only thing we did as far as a vacation.
         Never flew; I was 21 years old before I'd ever flown on a airplane.
         I was a teenager before I ever went to Myrtle Beach.
         Um, there weren't many restaurants.
         We just didn't eat out.
         My mother worked.
         So when she got home I was responsible for doing the cooking and having all that done when she got home from work.
         We just didn't, the big thing was to go to a place called Dino's Pizzas and get pizza.
         Um, is that 5 minutes?
      
   

   
   
      
         Hi Tom.
         What is your last name?
      
      
         My last name is Tom.
         Well, actually my whole name is Thomas R. Goedeke.
      
      
         Ah, OK!
         Tom I'll be asking you some questions and this will be the first one.
         What stories do you remember family members telling you when you were a child?
      
      
         Ha!
         How about a ghost story?
      
      
         Oh!
      
      
         When a person dies in my family they're supposed to visit all the relatives that are alive.
         And that was, that was a story that we used to hear.
         Of course when my 99 years old grandmother died, she didn't visit anybody.
         
      
      
         Who used to tell you this?
      
      
         My grandmother.
         I was kind of disappointed that she didn't remember to visit me after she passed away.
      
      
         Do you remember usually in what places she used to tell you?
         Like at home or special occasions?
      
      
         No.
         Just uh, when uh, I don't know, when, when we talked about family members.
         But, but as I recall, I never asked her if she'd ever had a, maybe she did, she did tell me that someone got on the end of her bed when she was a kid and it was a departed family member.
         It kind of,
         it scared her, but at the same time she knew whoever it was had uh, passed away.
         
         How about that?
      
      
         And it never happened to you?
      
      
         No.
         Is that wild?
      
      
         Yeah, wild.
         Do you tell that to your children?
      
      
         No, no I haven't so far I haven't.
         
         Yeah, I might have told Andrea, my daughter.
      
      
         Uh huh.
         And, and do you remember your house?
         How it looked?
         How it was?
      
      
         When I was a kid?
         Oh sure, very much.
         But I didn't grow up around here.
         I grew up in New Jersey.
      
      
         And your grandma was in New Jersey too?
      
      
         Yeah, she was in New Jersey, and she had a house that was not far from our house and it was just a little old house and you know, my mother, my parents, my mother grew up there, my uncles, my aunts.
         And I remember stories about grapes, how they had grapes in the backyard.
         They had a grape arbor, where the grapes grow, and my mother to this day hates having grapes.
         Grape anything.
         Because in the Depression they had grapes.
         You know, grape jelly, grapes this, grapes that, lots of grapes.
         So.
         --
      
      
         Wow!
         That is interesting.
         What about stories from your parents?
         From your father?
      
      
         From my father?
         He talks about being in the Depression and they were very poor, and they had to get coal.
         
         They had to uh, heat their house and there was a place where the trains had to slow down on this hill as they climbed with, with coal going to New York City and the kids would get on this train with big sacks, big heavy sacks called burlap sacks and they would steal coal from the train, put it in these big bags, throw the bags off jump off before the train got rolling fast again to go down the hill.
         And that's how they kept warm in the winter, and the winters were very severe.
      
      
         Do you remember how old your father was?
      
      
         He said uh, you know, ten years old,
         you know nine, just young.
      
      
         Um.
         What about your mom?
      
      
         My mom talks uh, tells stories about picking tomatoes and she used to pick beans and tomatoes for a nickel a bushel and a bushel is a big basket and they would,
         she'd work all day.
         Maybe it was, no, I think it was a nickel picking these beans and they got a nickel for it.
         This may or may not be true.
         It,
         maybe it was a quarter, it was a very small amount of money.
         Beans are a pain to pick.
      
      
         When she was a child?
      
      
         Yeah, when she was a kid.
         Sure.
      
      
         And where?
         In New Jersey?
      
      
         In New Jersey too.
         They're both from New Jersey.
      
      
         Wonderful.
         What about reading?
         Do you remember something about reading?
      
      
         I remember my grandmother, who was Welsh trying to teach me Welsh and she would sing nursery songs to me and tell me little poems in Welsh.
         I've never forgiven her for it.
         
      
      
         And why?
      
      
         It is a very difficult language.
         It's got clicks and it just doesn't sound like anything that is even, that we are even familiar with.
         Like a Romance language, like Italian or Spanish or French.
         This is stuff that's totally, "whoo," over the mountain and people just, Welsh is a dead language.
      
      
         And do you remember anything?
      
      
         Oh yeah, I remember the sounds of it.
         Like "orrorrrrr" kind of like "rorrrroruh," click, and she'd click and say funny things with the clicking sound.
         The clicking was fascinating, how she can talk and click at the same time was fascinating and then she wore dentures too and that made it even more fantastic.
         
      
      
         But um, favorite books when you were a child?
      
      
         My favorite books?
         Oh, I always liked Kon-Tiki by Thor Heyerdahl and he was a man who was in the South Pacific and he demonstrated that the Polynesians could weave basket boats together and travel all around the Pacific with these boats and to me that was fab, fabulous.
      
      
         So, you read those books.
      
      
         Oh Yeah.
         And I still have them.
         I actually looked at them once in a while and reminisce, you know, an unfulfilled dream.
      
      
         Wonderful.
         Thank you very much.
      
      
         Is that it?
      
      
         Yeah.
         You want to add something else?
      
      
         No, I guess that's about it.
      
      
         OK.
         Thank you very much.
      
   

   
   
      
         My name is Barbara Goodroe and the accent you hear is Georgian, where I was raised, even though I was born in Tampa, FL in 1930.
         And the story I want to share is based on WWII.
         There's a lot talking about it in these days.
         I was an eleven-year-old when, um, the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor, and I remember very clearly, um, the day that I walked out of a church, my Sunday School class, and walked into the church, a big, open atrium there and a large church in Columbus, GA, and saw grown men slapping their fist clenched fist in the palms of their hands, and I remember clearly the jaws that were clenched and the anger that was there in their faces.
         And then women were crying, standing around weeping.
         And, of course, all the juniors, which I was in the junior department, started saying, "What's happened?
         What's happened?"
         And then they said that America had been attacked.
         Pearl Harbor and many ships, uh, had been sunk and that many men, many, many men had been killed.
         And so, of course, I joined the other juniors crying as well.
         It made a huge impression on me and was a big thing.
         Columbus, GA is the home of Fort Benning, GA, where the largest infantry school in the world at that time was there, and as a kid walking to school, and believe it or not, I did walk four or five miles to school and I would go up Brown Avenue, which was at that time the only road that would allow the convoys to come through.
         And I would walk along the road to school and convoys of young men would, uh, ride by in the backs of trucks and I would wave at them and it was not a sexual thing in those days.
         It was just a friendly thing that these were young men that were going off to war all of them, most of them, well all of them enlisted men or draftees.
         I can remember one time specifically that, um, my dad, we had two, had a three bedroom home with one bath.
         Had one brother and we each had a bedroom and then my parents had a bedroom.
         And people began to knock on our front door and asking if we had a room to rent.
         And every place in Columbus at the time was full of people.
         I mean there was no, no rooms to rent.
         We had a garage in the back yard and had chickens that we raised.
         We backed up to a pecan grove.
         And, oh I don't know how many, I don't just want to estimate four or five young couples would ring the doorbell and ask if we had a room to rent and we would, Ma or Dad would, say no.
         And finally this one couple named Ed and Sally Duffind, who came from Erie, PA, and they knocked on the door and he was a lieutenant in the infantry and headed for Germany.
         And they said, "Well, if you would just let us uh, uh stay in your garage," and my dad answered and said, "Well, it has a dirt floor."
         And they said, "Well, we don't care we don't mind that.
         We'll just bring us some cots from the Army and we'll go to the, uh, service station," which was several blocks away.
         There was not an open place, a service station one very corner in those days.
         We called them filling stations instead of service stations.
         And Dad said, "Well, uh, no I just can't imagine you staying in a garage."
         Said, "It's drafty and in the winter you would be cold," and I think it was the fall of the year.
         And they looked so forlorn that my dad said, "Well, come in and we'll talk about it."
         So I moved in at that juncture with my brother.
         We moved the twin beds back there and moved his bed up in the front bedroom and for, until that young couple, the, the husband went off to Germany we didn't know whether he'd ever see his wife again, uh, Sally.
         And we just became very, very close friends and loved them dearly.
         And, uh, he did go off to war and did come back and many years after that nearly every year they would come down to see us in Columbus from Erie.
         In fact, when he came back, one time he gave me a beautiful large pearl, perfect pearl and years and years later, when my father died in 1978, I had, took some of the money that I got from his inheritance and, uh, bought a heart and placed that pearl in the center of the heart and now wear it; one of my treasured possessions.
         That's just kind of a little aside from the war days.
         But I can remember at that time that we'd go out to have uh we played softball and I happened to be, when I was 12 years old I was a freshman in high school.
         In fact, uh, I had skipped a grade in grammar school is why I was so young to go off to high school.
         When all my grandchildren ask me, uh tell me how smart I was to skip a grade.
         Then I have to admit that the grade I skipped was kindergarten
      because I was taller than the other kids and so that's, we only had eleven grades in those days and so I graduated when I just turned 16 which was entirely too young but I'm getting ahead of myself a little bit.
         We played softball at PE in high school and I remember very clearly one day when I was 12 somebody said uh, "There's an airplane," and we all stopped.
         The game stopped, the PE stopped and we all looked up in the sky and tried to find where the airplane was.
         And it just shows how much our nation has changed because there were so few airplanes falling passing over in the sky at that time that a class at high school would stop and look for it to see if they could find it.
         And finally, uh, we could see it just very vaguely.
         In those days it wasn't up wasn't a jet didn't have the jet stream.
         Uh I also remember other things that happened during that time of our country I remember sitting at the feet of my, the radio.
         We had a nice sized one that sat on the floor and listening to President Roosevelt, uh, give his famous speech of a day that will live in infamy and us sitting in total silence, uh, as the four members of our family listening to it.
         I also remember one time, uh, Warm Springs, GA was not very far from where I lived and that's where President Roosevelt would come as uh, uh, when he had polio when he was a young man I think.
         At any rate he would come to Warm Springs and he'd come through Columbus.
         And at the time one day I was, mother and I came out of the doctor's office.
         We rode the bus because we only had one car in our family.
         When dad and mother moved when I was four years old from FL to, uh, Columbus.
         He moved, he was making $25 a week and I remember as a small child I had my tonsils out of all things at four years old in a dentist's office.
         And mother saved five cents a week and at the time that I had my tonsils out she had saved $50 and that's what it cost to get them out at five dollars a week.
         And I'll let you figure up how long that took to save $50.
         But back again to the war years one time we came out of the doctor's office and I was just standing on the corner and along came Roosevelt's famous car with no roof on it no top on it.
         Uh, well he was driving.
         It was equipped for a polio person to drive and he was driving.
         There was someone in the car with him and I don't remember anything about that.
         But I do remember that we stood and watched him go by and waved at him.
         I don't remember whether he waved back or not so I did get to see President Roosevelt himself and in person so that was a big thrill for me as a young person.
         Um, there are so many things I remember about those years.
         I had mother's youngest brother Buster was sent to, um, the Pacific theater and he was in the Battle of Guadalcanal and all of the big, he was in the infantry and in all of the big battles over there from island hopping.
         And I, one of the regrets that I have in my life, now that I'm almost 71, is the fact that I threw away his V mail.
         That was, he just wrote beautiful letters and he was only about six years older than I was, maybe five years, so I corresponded with him and wrote him very faithfully a couple of times a week and I wish I had kept his letters because they were so graphic descriptions.
         I do regret getting rid of them.
         I also had another young son of one of Mother's and Dad's friends that wrote gorgeous letters and beautiful letters, and was in a lot of the fighting in the Pacific.
         So we also had letters from the Duffinds that I mentioned earlier.
         I wish I'd kept them.
         Another experience that I remember very clearly was riding on the train from, we were going down to see my grandparents at Bradenton, Palmetto, FL actually below Tampa.
         And we would go down there and spend about a month or six weeks every summer on a train and we had to change trains in Jacksonville, FL.
         Dad would drive me to Albany, drive us to Albany, GA to catch the train and it would be full of enlisted men heading off to the war.
         And sometimes they would be standing up in the train trying to get leave before they went overseas and there I was a child of maybe 11 or 12 years old and, uh, I can remember very clearly the young man's face that taught me two or three new games of solitaire that I still teach my grandchildren how to play now and still play myself sporadically and remember that time.
         I also remember how gracious they were and there was no cursing and no ugly language and they were very gracious to mother who was traveling with two children.
         Years later when I was a mother myself and had two children I decided I would rego that route and I actually caught a train to Palmetto to see my grandparents who were dead then but to see my aunt and uncle, and, uh, I saw how hard it was for a woman to travel on a train.
         I had a small child had a two and-a-half year old and a baby.
         And I can remember that I had one of the first boxes of disposal diapers and I stood up in the train in the center of the train to go to the restroom and take Donna and change her diaper and she went to the bathroom and it all came down my dress and down her leg and puddled on the floor.
         And so much for disposable diapers.
         I never tried them again.
         But I can see now how they have become a boom to motherhood.
         We now have 12 grandchildren.
         One of them has gone to be with the Lord at age three.
         We have two great-grandchildren and my husband and I have been married 51years.
         We've been in Charlotte since August of 1998 and we came here to live, uh, near our second daughter and her husband who live here in Charlotte and have four grandchildren.
         And there's one last little thing.
         Sunday morning we're picking up all our grandkids and we're all going out at 4:30 a.m.
         to watch the meteor shower.
         It's going to be an adventure and then we'll go to McDonald's for breakfast.
      
      
         That's good.
         Thank you.
      
   

   
   
      
         OK tell me about whenever you broke your jaw.
      
      
         I'm about to have to rig it.
         
         I was in high school, and one day I was helping my father outside put a window in, replacing a window, on the garage door.
         I had previously broke the window by throwing a baseball through it on, by accident.
         Well, we was replacing this window, and we got it fixed, and my dad was like, "Let's go for a little bike ride."
         It was probably about 5:30 in the evening, you know, right before mom had supper ready, so we went for a quick bike ride.
         We got on the bikes and went down the road a little piece, and finally my dad said, "OK, I'll race you back, back to the uh, house, you wuss."
         I said, "All right!"
         So uh
         , I passed my dad, I passed him, and about that time my brakes, I don't know what happened, my front brakes got, went in the spokes somehow and it, it made me uh, it flipped me in the air about one and a half times, and I got, we had toe clips on our bikes and finally, finally my feet came out of my toe clips and my chin hit the pavement and--
      
      
         Were you near your house?
      
      
         Yeah kind of.
      
      
         Sort of.
      
      
         We was close by.
         It was probably, it was over, we was half mile from my house.
         But uh, my chin hit the pavement, and as soon as it hit I felt, I felt something crack right here, and I just laid there on the road kind of shocked and my dad was like, "Kevin!
         Kevin!"
         you know, came up to me and was like uh, "Oh crap," you know
         .
         And he said a few words, and he didn't want to move me because he, he saw the way I fell and thought maybe I'd broke some ribs or something and he didn't want to move me.
         So I am laying here in the middle of the road, and he kept asking if I am all right and I was like, "Yeah I'm all right," because I knew something was wrong with me, and I hate hospitals and, and I don't want to go to a hospital if something happens to me.
         But uh, I was like, "I'm all right."
         Well he picked me up, and put me on the side of the road, and he raced back to the house.
      
      
         
         He left you on the side of the road?
      
      
         He had to.
      
      
         I know.
      
      
         So he raced back to the house to get my mom and get the car.
         Well, they came and got me and took me back to the house, and my mom, I, I was shaking and stuff, my mom was afraid I was going in shock, so she put a blanket around me, and she was like, "Kevin are you OK?"
         and I was like, "Yeah I'm OK Mom.
         I don't need to go to the hospital or anything like that, I am fine."
         And she goes, "OK open your mouth for me."
         So I opened my mouth, and I couldn't get it, I couldn't shut it back.
      
      
         You had to go to the hospital like that
         ?
      
      
         Yeah.
         She was like, she was like, "OK you got to go to the hospital."
         So I started going nuts
         .
         Well, I get to the hospital, and they had to put me in this wheelchair, and they rolled me in because I couldn't walk.
         I was just so weak from I don't know, I guess what was just happening.
      
      
         From the flipping?
      
      
         Yeah, and, um, I rolled in there and they was like, "Oh man was you in a bad car accident?"
         
         And because I looked horrible, I mean my chin was bleeding because I busted my chin, and I just looked bad and they, my dad was like, "Nah he was in a bicycle accident."
      
      
         
         Just flipped his bike.
      
      
         So they took me to the hospital room, and I'm going nuts people are having to hold me down while they pull as, asphalt out of my chin--
      
      
         Oh gross.
      
      
         Because my chin hurt so bad, sewed me up.
         And
         I don't know I never knew what was coming I, I, I never knew what they did when you broke a jaw.
      
      
         Did they put you to sleep?
      
      
         Nah, well like that night they told me they'd let me go home and stuff from the hospital, and my, I mean my, before I went to bed my dad was like, "Well you got to go see a specialist tomorrow," and I was like "Wh, what's he going to do?"
         and he was like, "Well he'll just tell you you're going to have to, you know, eat mashed potatoes and stuff the whole time, soup and that's it," and I was like, "OK."
         Well, that night I couldn't sleep at all because it felt like a brick wall, a brick, I mean a brick wall was on my head, so much pressure was on my chin and stuff, my jaw.
         So the next morning we go and it was Doctor Trevez I believe.
      
      
         That's who did my um,
         wisdom teeth.
      
      
         Yeah.
      
      
         I liked him.
      
      
         Yeah I did too, actually.
         Well Doctor Trevez was like, "Well, we are going to have to wire your mouth shut," and I had never heard of this.
         This freaked me out
         I'm a freshman in high school, I'm like, "What?
         !" and I, I couldn't talk with it, I was like, "Oh crap."
         So they had to put me to sleep, they had to put a I.V. in my, my arm and stuff.
         And
         what scared me the most was when he said before he put the I.V. in my arm, before he did, say before he did surgery, before he was going to do the surgery, he said, "OK uh, let's have a word of prayer."
      
      
         Yeah I was like OK, please.
      
      
         I was like, "Wooh."
      
      
         You thought you were going under.
      
      
         So I, so I did, I never heard him finish the prayer though.
         I was, I was out--
      
      
         Um-huh.
      
      
         Before he got done.
         And I woke up and my mouth was wired shut.
         I ra, I ran around talking like this all the time.
         It was like--
      
      
         Carla probably tortured you.
      
      
         It was like wired shut for two months.
         That was probably the most awkward two months of my whole life because I, because I had to drink all this stuff at school.
         I had to take Ensure and milkshakes with me to school.
         I couldn't eat regular food, I had to slurp it up with a straw, and I, I had uh, was having to drink all these liquids and stuff at least every thirty minutes to an hour so I wouldn't lose weight.
         They were afraid of me losing too much weight.
      
      
         Uh-huh.
      
      
         So uh, I had to go through that in high school.
         And you know, people started doing the "Kevin Talk."
      
      
         What, what was that?
      
      
         It was like this, you know, everybody started when they would walk by me in the hall they would , "What's up Kevin?"
      
      
         
         Oh my God!
      
      
         And it was called the "Kevin Talk."
      
      
         That's you Burns folks.
         That's what y'all do out there.
      
      
         And ever since then, every time I eat now my uh, my left cheek starts to sweat.
      
      
         It sweats
         ?
      
      
         It's got a little circle where it sweats when I eat because I, it did nerve damage--
      
      
         Oh.
      
      
         To my jaw and stuff, there was nerve damage so I sweat every time I eat there, just a little circle of sweat.
      
      
         So you sweat about six or seven times a day
         ?
      
      
         Yeah.
      
   

   
   
      
         I'm interviewing Avis Gregory.
         Avis is from NY, and she's 42 years old.
         She's Black American.
         And Avis has some stories that she'd like to, um, tell us regarding reading and, um, some experiences she's had with books and with teachers.
         Now Avis, you had mentioned to me before about you had a fifth grade teacher who you really enjoyed; who, uh, got you excited about reading.
         But did you have any other, uh, experiences with reading that brings back memories prior to fifth grade, or did it really start with fifth grade?
      
      
         Umm, reading has always been a passion for me and, um, that was probably one of my favorite Christmas presents growing up.
         My mom knew that if she got me a new book, I was happy
         .
         Umm so, it didn't just begin in fifth grade, but when you had, um, asked me about my favorite book--
      
      
         Um-hum.
      
      
         --it took me back to fifth grade because that's when I fell in love with my favorite book.
         Well, it's one of my favorite books now, but then it was; it became my passion.
      
      
         What fav, favorite book was that?
         Do you remember?
      
      
         Yes, of course!
         
         It was the dictionary!
      
      
         Oh really?
      
      
         Yes.
      
      
         I just did a report on the dictionary!
      
      
         Really?
         Well she, part of the fifth grade, teachers had pretty much required, five-word, that you learn five words a day, 25 words a week.
         And that was pretty much it as far as vocabulary and spelling.
      
      
         Um-hum.
      
      
         Mrs. Agee was, I think, was perceived by a lot of the kids as a tyrant, but her, um, I don't know exactly how to express it, intensity regarding //
      
      
         // That's a good word!
         
         //
      
      
         Um, grammar and English.
         It was just something that I kind of gobbled up.
         It was wonderful for me.
         She required 20 words a day, a hundred words.
         And you had to not only be able spell it and give a definition for it, but also had to be able to use it in a sentence.
      
      
         Ooh.
      
      
         And so vocabulary became electric for me.
         I mean I just, and, and, therefore, the dictionary itself became something that I really, I mean if I had to choose one book besides my Bible
         it would be the dictionary!
         I don't think I could live without it!
      
      
         That's amazing because most people, when, when, they talk about their favorite book, it's usually a short story or a novel that is a prose.
         And certainly the dictionary isn't prose.
         So that is really unusual!
         I've never heard of somebody who had their favorite book as the dictionary!
      
      
         
            Oh.
      
      
         So that's, that's really interesting.
         Now you had to learn 20 words a day?
         So a hundred words a week?
      
      
         That's right.
      
      
         How did you go about doing that?
      
      
         Oh we had assignments where, um, we had to, um, write out the definition, actually write out, you know, using the word in a sentence.
         And we had, um, spelling bee types of situations where we had to spell the word.
         Um, we tested on it and, um, but it was like every week, like clockwork.
         Um, we were expected to, to, um, produce you know, this homework.
         And, um, for me it was exciting and fun.
         Everybody else was like, "Oh no!
         Please not this!"
         
      
      
         And she gave you the 20 words?
      
      
         Oh yes!
         Uh-huh.
      
      
         And then did you have to look them up yourself?
      
      
         Absolutely!
      
      
         So that's how your involvement got in with the dictionary.
         You had to look them up yourself.
      
      
         Yes.
      
      
         Well, what about looking up words?
         Why would that be an exciting thing for you?
      
      
         Well, um, at heart, I'm pretty much an adventurer, and, um, as a child, uh, stories were one way of exploring, um, for me.
         But, um, when, I don't know, I learn something new, it just feeds something inside of me that, uh, I don't know, maybe my enthusiasm for life is just taken to another, another, level.
         As an adult, uh, of course, it has expanded into other areas, but I still, um, enjoy, uh, spending time with my friend the dictionary.
         Um, one of the things that my husband teases me about is that when, when I have episodes, during my chronic illness, and I have to be horizontal, um, sometimes I'll play Scrabble by myself.
         And I'll play both sides and, but I don't play, of course,
         the way you would in competition.
         But I have my dictionary there so I can say, "Ok, now, what?
         You know, this looks like it ought to be a word, let's see if there's anything."
         
         So, I use it as a learning experience and find out new things.
      
      
         Interesting!
         I've never heard of it solo!
         
         That's really interesting!
         When, um, when you went beyond the fif, that was the fifth grade wasn't it?
         When you went beyond fifth grade, um, did you continue on, did the next teacher continue on that passion with vocabulary?
      
      
         Um, not really.
         Um, but when I left fifth grade, I also left Brooklyn, and when I came to the VA school system things were very different.
         Actually, um, there was a sense in which I think I was a little bit ahead of where folks were, um, in VA at that time.
         Um, in, the, um, the middle school, it was a major adjustment for me, culturally.
         Um, where we were from in Brooklyn, it was a very multicultural environment, and, um, it was very, all the races were kind of accepted to a certain degree.
         Um, actually, um, I didn't even have any kind of racial, um, prejudicial-type experience except for, um, from Blacks which--
      
      
         Huh, that's unusual.
      
      
         Which, I know.
         Well, not really, not as unusual as you might think.
         But, um, when we moved to VA, and I started to go to school here, um, the rejection I got was because I was a Northerner, and, uh, well, not here because I am in Charlotte now, but there.
      
      
         Um-hum.
      
      
         And, uh, they were very unhappy with the way I spoke and, um, I tended to stay to myself.
         I tended to read a lot.
         I really with, withdrew socially--
      
      
         Um-hum.
      
      
         To, into books.
         And, um, the teachers themselves didn't necessarily emphasize it, it just became, the library became my favorite place.
      
      
         Humm.
      
      
         And, if at all possible, I would get permission, like, to spend my lunch hours and to, um, spend my homeroom hours, anytime I could get to the library, it was, uh, a haven for me.
         And, uh, uh, I prob, the librarian was probably my, my, best friend.
         
      
      
         I can imagine why!
         
      
      
         Yeah, it was, uh, a, a good outlet for me.
         In fact, I, um, when I got to high school, which was in VA, I, um, I remember beginning in the biography section and just starting with "A".
         And just reading each book and, um, just keeping on going until I got to the end, and, um--
      
      
         Boy that was a real task wasn't it?
      
      
         I didn't consider it a task.
         It was wonderful!
         I mean, I would devour a book a day, and my mom would say, "Honey, take your nose out of a that book and SOCIALIZE!
         
         Talk to your brothers and sisters!"
         
         I would read while I ate, I'd read on the bus, I would read while I walked down the street, if I could get away with it!
         
      
      
         So, you were really absorbed in that.
      
      
         I did.
         I read all the time.
      
      
         All-consuming.
      
      
         It was.
         It was.
         And my mom had to really stay on me to be more well rounded, um, because it was very easy for me to escape into that because I was, um, rejection was, that was very hard to, to deal with.
         And one of the things that I did, attempted to do, was to absorb the language around me, and that was part of my, my interest.
         I mean, I al, because we were always around so many different cultures, I always had an interest in language and an interest in cultures.
         When we moved to VA, it was not as diversified.
         It was almost, that was where, it was like, uh, I really got to see black and white division.
         I went to school at a predominately white uh, school after my sixth and seventh grades--
      
      
         Uh-uh.
      
      
         And, umm, I didn't have a problem with that.
         I mean, I grew up accepting all races, so I didn't have a problem with that.
         But, because I didn't have a problem with that, there were those who had a problem
         with me!
      
      
         With you?
      
      
         And so, umm, so, it was very easy for me to withdraw from people into a world of reading.
      
      
         Um-hum.
      
      
         And, uh,
         , it's more balanced now
         .
         But, I don't have to do that.
      
      
         Do you ever look back and, and regret the fact that you spent all that time in those books?
         Do you think, in other words, do you look at your experience as being a negative one and it drew you into, forced you into those books or did you think it was in some odd way, more of a good experience because you have absorbed your life in those books?
      
      
         I didn't consider it negative, I mean it was negative from the standpoint that, that I was being rejected in that respect.
         But the books, having the opportunity, it was fun to me!
         It wasn't, it, you know, as if, say I had been in a situation where I hadn't had the rejection and there I was more accepted socially.
         I don't know that I wouldn't have done the same thing!
         
         
         But I loved reading!
         And whether it was by, I really liked true stories more than novels.
         There are few novels that I can enjoy.
         It's just that, and maybe part of my critical rigging comes from--.
         I tend to be very critical of my own writing.
      
      
         Um-hum.
      
      
         And if a story is not very well written, it just leaves me, disappointed.
      
      
         Um-hum.
      
      
         And true life tends to be more fulfilling in reading to me than someone else's imagination.
         I guess, really, I'm not, I guess there are very few things that I find, um, where I find that someone else's imagination intrigues me enough to, for me to read a lot of their material.
      
      
         So you prefer more of the biographies?
      
      
         Absolutely.
      
      
         Is that the same in movie watching?
      
      
         Yes, yes.
         Um, my husband and I both tend to be very critical when it comes to story lines and stuff like that.
         And while we're watching something, I'll say, "OK honey, what's going to happen next?"
         Or I'll tell him what I think is going to happen next.
         And if the way that the plot is, um, constructed, if they've got like loopholes, or got, if it's a non-sequitur.
         If things do not follow what I consider logical, or if they make some kind of leap that is not explained or not presented at least so you can leap with them, or see how they made that leap, then it leaves me cold.
         I really don't want to, um, watch that show any more!
         
      
      
         So it basically, uh, turns you from the, um, plot instead of going with the plot.
         It just turns you away from it.
      
      
         Absolutely!
      
      
         You lose interest.
         Have you ever thought about, because of your love for books, have you ever thought about writing?
      
      
         Absolutely.
         I don't perceive in myself, and maybe this, I'll gain this as I get older, but my attempts at short stories, at least, have left me flat
         .
         I don't do very well in cultivating the characters, you know.
         Now, the writing that I do, like the journaling that I do, um, of course, that's real life so that has a different intensity.
      
      
         Um-hum.
      
      
         Um, the poem, the poetry that I write, and the songs that I write, um, depending on whether I felt that it has meet, met, I guess, my criteria for excellence, um, I, I am working on compiling my poetry.
      
      
         Um-hum.
      
      
         But, um, I haven't gotten to the point where I feel like it's ready yet.
         And my family is chomping-at-the-bit ready for me!
         "When are you going to publish?"
         
         And when it's ready, it'll be ready, and I really can't rush that.
      
      
         Uh-huh, that's because that's the creative part.
         And, and you know that, that creativity is not something you can force.
      
      
         No, but even having, I mean, I think I have, my mom, my grandmother says, "I know you have enough stuff put together!"
         Like, it doesn't take that much!
         
         But, um, the book that I'm working on, there's a certain flow that I anticipated having, and at this point there're gaps--
      
      
         Um-hum.
      
      
         And I don't know what fills those gaps yet.
         But, umm, as soon as those gaps are filled, then the book will be ready, and we'll, we'll move, you know.
         By that point in time, the Lord will have shown me, you know, who to present it to, as far as, uh, uh, presenting it for publication.
      
      
         Uh-huh.
         Have you ever, because, uh, of your race, have you ever thought about writing about, um, you know, the Blacks and culture and, and, maybe, have you ever had any interest, also, in any Black writers?
      
      
         Oh, absolutely.
         Um, Yes, to both of those questions.
         Um, our family is a very mixed family.
         My heritage is Black and Indian and White and Jewish, that I know of
         .
         There may be others
         , but those are the, the, the strains that I know of or the races that I know of, and, um, I know that there are gaps in what I know.
         And
         , I haven't really thought about, um, how to present that.
         I mean, I always thought of it as a wonderful heritage, and I love being `mixed,' so-to-speak.
         Um, I think it gives me an advantage.
         I mean, I feel connected to more than just my race because my race are so many.
         
         Umm, but, because our family history, or I mean, there is so much history that I don't know; but, because of so many complex issues regarding
         my family, I don't think the older members of my family could probably appreciate me writing about, umm, our racial heritage at this particular point in time.
         Maybe, umm, maybe at some point in the future, although, now that you have brought it up, I'll have to consider it
         more strongly
         .
      
      
         I just thought about it because, being February, and, and, um, it's Black American History Mon th or something like that, and I'm, I'm doing a report on that on Zora Neale Hurston's Their Eyes Were Watching God and, um, I found her to be very interesting, but uh, she writes solely upon the Black culture and her experiences in growing up.
         So I didn't know if you had any experiences reading any of the materials that the Black writers, female Black writers have, whether that material interested you.
      
      
         Maya Angelou was probably the first that really captured my attention.
         Um, her, I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings, um, having experienced pain in my childhood, her writing about her pain which, you know, I write about my pain privately in my journal, but writing it for someone else to read is a totally different story!
         
         And I thought that was very courageous for her, and I still enjoy listening to her and hearing the wisdom that she has to share, um, regarding not letting life's experiences bitter you.
         And so, she's one of the Black female writers that attracted me.
         Um, I've read a lot.
         Unfortunately, I don't remember everything
         I've ever read!
      
      
         \\I have the same problem!
         \\
      
      
         \\And that's challenging!
         \\
         But one of the things that, um, I guess if any particular subject that I would feel that I might write about, it wouldn't just be from, like, uh, the Black culture because, other than, my experiences in the Black culture tend to not be traditional from the standpoint that I don't seem to fit in or be generally excepted um, at least from a childhood perspective.
         Now it's not so much of a problem.
         I mean, but I live in a multi-cultural world now.
         Um, but even in our family, it is incredible to me how the different shades of color of our skin bring prejudices from both sides or from, from all the different shades.
         Whether, I mean, my grandmother, who was on my dad's side was mostly Indian.
         As a matter of fact, I don't know if she had any Black blood in her.
         She married a man who had Black blood, but um, she was ostracized in her family because of the Indian coloring.
         She had more of it than any of the other children so they would call her derogatory names.
      
      
         Um-hum.
      
      
         And um, from her offspring, which some married into the white race, some married into the Black race--
      
      
         Um-hum.
      
      
         And, there's, from black to white there are varying attitudes.
         And I was really shocked.
         I thought my family was very small on my dad's side.
         As a matter of fact, I didn't even know that we had the myriad of cousins that we do!
      
      
         Umm.
      
      
         Come to find out at my dad's death that, um, one of the reasons that he shielded us from them was because of their hatred for us which was incredible to me!
         I had no clue.
      
      
         \\Yes.
         \\
      
      
         \\And to see it was shocking.
         \\ So that might be something that I would write about.
      
      
         Um-hum.
      
      
         But don't know.
         I would have to have a positive reason for writing about it because,
         you know, at this point, I don't have a happy ending to the story!
         
      
      
         Yes.
      
      
         Um, just sadness.
      
      
         Um-hum.
         Some people don't write for others, they write for themselves.
         It just so happens that others take part in sharing it by reading it.
      
      
         That's true.
         Like, I write for myself in my journal and I don't hide things in that, but I haven't gotten to the point of sharing my journals with the world!
         
      
      
         Did your journaling come from a teacher's, uh, uh, expectation of you?
         I know that some teachers, they require a student to write in a journal everyday.
         I didn't have that experience, did you?
      
      
         I did in high school.
         I was already writing, but it was not every day or structured.
         Um, Miss Red, I think it was in tenth grade, required us to write everyday in our journal and then get to turn it in.
      
      
         Um-hum.
      
      
         And that was when I began, um, journaling with consistency.
         And, um, and being willing to let, you know, someone know my heart, so to speak, because I felt very privately.
         Um, my mom had always warned us to be very careful about what we put on paper, so the really innermost things of my heart I didn't write, um, until I got much older.
      
      
         Um-hum.
      
      
         But, it was that high school experience that, that solidified it for me.
         Then we took a Discipleship Class, um, my husband and I, that, that, um, really taught us how to study the Bible and journaling and Bible Study became enmeshed, so to speak, for me.
         So when I spent time in the Scriptures, I, um, write my insights and sometimes I write my prayers and I also, you know, pour out my heart.
      
      
         Um-hum.
      
      
         My journals have, uh, taken a much different character as, uh, as I've grown older and learned different things.
      
      
         Uh-huh.
         Uh-huh.
         The teacher in high school that started you with your journal, did she also, um, did she also activate in you a desire for any reading or other types of writing, or did another teacher?
         Or did that stop back in your sixth grade class?
      
      
         No, um, actually that teacher did encourage me to write.
         Um, I was already `homing' as we call it.
         Um, and she enjoyed and encouraged me to do that.
         It was actually the librarian in my high school experience that, um, she was, uh, also, uh, a creative writer and, um, we would share poetry.
         And, um, I think more than my teacher, she really, I guess you would say, inspired me to, uh, cultivate it and express myself more so in that, that way.
      
      
         So your, your writing first came about in high school.
      
      
         Umm, no.
         I, I can't remember when I wasn't writing poetry.
         I just always was making up things.
      
      
         Um-hum.
      
      
         Umm, high school was when I would write it down and keep it!
         
         I mean I have things now that I can go back to, uh, poems that I wrote in high school, but I was writing before that, I just, you know how things just disappear?
      
      
         Yes.
      
      
         We moved quite a bit and, you know, I have no clue what happened with all of those--.
         Well, Mom had six kids, so it probably ended up, you know, in the trash because it was just such a volume of mail--
      
      
         Right.
      
      
         --of, uh, not mail, uh, schoolwork and paperwork, and stuff like that.
         Uh, but I've been really glad that I've held on to the early things that I wrote.
         One of the poems that, um, I still pull out and read from time to time is, um, "Can I Be Me All By Myself?"
      
      
         Do you remember it?
      
      
         Oh, from memory?
         No, um.
      
      
         What sparked you to write that one?
      
      
         Uh, one of the things that I didn't, I would never be able to articulate as a child; but, looking back, um, there was a, there was a certain chameleon quality to my personality.
         I was very much a pleaser, and whatever the authority figure who I was with wanted from me, was what I tried to give them.
         And, um, I guess in a, in a way, I was kind of
         frustrated with my own chameleon self.
         And, um, I didn't know who I was.
         I was always being someone else or what was expected of me and, um, that's not necessarily a bad thing except for, um, sometimes it was a very
         , um, the expectations were opposites.
         And so, you know, if one person wants you to be the opposite of another person,
         I mean, who are you really when you please, when you are trying to please both people, you know?
         God forbid, they'd both be in the same room at the same time!
         
      
      
         That would be a problem, wouldn't it?
      
      
         It would.
         It would.
         But one of the books, one of the, one of the, uh, writers that I have been able to appreciate, um, is A.A. Milne.
         And, as you can see, my Pooh characters, I've got a collection of the original Pooh Tales.
         And, I really appreciated the original stories from this perspective.
         He captured personalities in a way that, um, I still go back to th, those, uh, Pooh and Eeyore.
         When I'm, my husband and I talk personality a lot and, you know, what personality type is a particular person and we really found it to be very helpful in understanding them and we realize that no one is one personality type; we're all conglomerates.
         But he, the way that he wrote the characters and um, uh, captured the different personality types was, has intrigued me even to this day, and I can really appreciate, um, how he did that.
         And there are times when I can really identify with Pooh, and then there are, I have my Eeyore Days!
         
         I don't always appreciate what Disney has done with it, now, because they have commercialized it so, but, um, that's one of the few things, I, I never really was a cartoon kid?
         I mean, my siblings watched, and I know what they were, but, um, it was so funny.
         We had a situation.
         We were at a family reunion, and we were playing a game.
         I can't, I think, oh, it was Pictionary.
         And, um, the, my partner was drawing a anvil, but I can't remember now what he was trying to get me to say, but it was from a cartoon.
         It was, like, "I don't know what that cartoon was about!"
         
         I didn't watch cartoons!
         
         Cartoons really just, I mean, even to this day I think, "How can people watch that junk!"
         But, Winnie the Pooh is one of the cartoons that I can appreciate!
         But, the rest of them, I can lump them all in the same bag, and I don't have much use for them.
         But, um, I can appreciate Milne's work.
      
      
         Did your poem and his work, the poem about who you are--
      
      
         Uh-huh.
      
      
         Did you seem to assimilate that into his descriptions and characters?
         Did you try to say, "I'm more like this one than this one."
         ? Did you make any connections there?
      
      
         No, not al all.
         I wasn't so much even, I, I did not even know how to, I wish I could put my hands on it.
         If I had of thought about it, I had no clue that we were even going to talk about him.
         I think, where in the world do I have that?
         Umm, I know I have written it down, but I am trying to think, where is my book?
         
         It will come to me, and I'll, I'll maybe be able to find it, and I don't mind sharing it with you.
         But, my, my focus was in, in solitude.
         I was unsure about who I really was because I was pretending so much, so it wasn't, I had no clue.
         At, at that point in time I wasn't even thinking in the personality realm, and I hadn't drawn any connection to it.
         Um, it was, it was, just, um, more of my, you know, how the teenagers go through, uh, "Trying to find myself", a questioning period?
         And that was one of the poems that came out of my, "Who Am I?
         What am I doing here?
         And why?"
         type of,
         you know, struggle.
         But, um, It's been really, uh, encouraging for me as I have, um, grown up, and, um, I look back to that poem because, to some degree, I have learned now that I can be myself all by myself.
         I can be me, you know.
         I don't have to be a pleaser, although I do, I still enjoy people being pleased with me
         .
         Who doesn't?
         But, umm, I've, I've learned that, um, the Lord is pleased with me and if I do what is pleasing to Him, you know, everybody else, the chips fall where they may b.
         
         That's just the way it has to be.
      
      
         Going back to your high school, your favorite book in fifth grade, wasn't it the dictionary?
      
      
         Uh-huh.
      
      
         Did that change?
         Did your favorite book become something else when you grew up a little bit more and \\you were in high school?
         \\
      
      
         \\Well\\, it didn't, the dictionary is still one of my favorite books, but one of the books that I read over and over again, and I still periodically check it out in the library and read, Little Women.
         Uh, Louisa Alcott.
         Um, her writings, not just Little Women, but Little Men and Jo's Boys, um, I, I've appreciated, um, her imagination.
         
         In some parts, I know it was based on her life, and so there is a ring of reality, but there again, I hadn't realize this till we were talking, but you have the different personality types.
      
      
         That's true.
      
      
         And, um, I kind of identified with Jo, who, of course, is a writer.
         And, although, I was, I wasn't really tomboyish, but I was definitely not interested in boys
         .
         And, umm, so, I, uh, I've actually, that's one of the few movies when I see, when they've done remakes of it different times, that I've been able to appreciate every single version of it.
         Usually, if I've read the book and then see the movie, I'm like, uh (sigh)
         --
      
      
         It takes something away from the book.
      
      
         Well, my imagination is very different from their imagination, so, I don't, when I read the book my imagination is engaged and, um, I think of things a certain way, and it's very rare when I can appreciate somebody else's imagination if it's contrary to what my imagination says.
      
      
         Um-hum.
      
      
         Um, so that became, that has become one of my favorites, Little Women, that started in, um, high school.
         Um, there is something I've got to tell you, it's just, uh,
         uh, one of the things that my sister, who is, like, two years behind me said.
         I couldn't understand her frustration, she says, "Do you know, that there's not a book in this library that your name isn't in!"
         
         I don't know why that tickles me so much, but--
      
      
         Back in those days, when you check out a book, \\they put your name in it.
         \\
      
      
         \\You wrote your name in it.
         \\ And she couldn't, and every time she checked out a book, my name was already there!
         
            . But that probably went to the fact that she wanted to be the oldest and, umm, that was something that reminded her that she was not the first!
      
      
         Not the first one!
         That's interesting.
      
      
         
         I know!
         
         Why it would bother her so much, I don't know, but--
      
      
         Sibling rivalry.
      
      
         Yeah.
      
      
         It doesn't matter what it's in!
      
      
         It was from her end, more than from my end because I was the oldest.
         You couldn't dispute
         that
         .
         But, um, one of the other areas, uh, I did learn to enjoy, I can't remember exactly when it was, but science fiction became, became intriguing to me, and I think it was during high school years.
      
      
         Now, that's very creative.
         That would be the antithesis of biography!
         
      
      
         Oh, I know, I know!
         
         Not that I would appreciate everybody's science fiction, but, uh, there is a trilogy that I ha ve read, and, it's The Foundation Trilogy, and, uh, I'm trying to remember who wrote it.
         I can't think of the author right now, but it's one that both my husband and I have enjoyed.
         And, matter of right, we point back to it.
         Lord, please help me to remember his name.
         I can't think of the writer's name, but the writer does so well with, um, with intrigue and irony.
         And one of the things that I have found, whether it's in a movie or a book, it's got to engage me psychologically on some level.
         I mean, I don't really go for, for "fluff" very much.
         I
         have a low, low tolerance for it.
      
      
         Um-hum.
      
      
         Um, so, um, I can't believe, I can't believe I can't think of this man's name.
         It must be the chronic fatigue
         robbing me!
         Um, it will probably pop in at some point, so I'll let you know.
         But, um, have you ever read The Foundation Trilogies?
      
      
         No I haven't.
      
      
         Oh
         .
         For the most part I think it's pretty clean and that's something else I really appreciate, is, when I don't have to do deal with a lot of profanity or unwholesomeness.
         You know, there is so much that you can write about that's good and wholesome and intriguing without going into the areas that are unprofitable that, um, and I don't, I haven't read The Foundation again in, like, probably the last five years, but, um, periodically I'll feel like, "I've got to visit this book again!"
      
      
         So, you don't mind re-reading?
      
      
         Oh, no, especially, that's how I know what my favorite books are because they are books I go back to.
      
      
         Go back to--
      
      
         Yeah.
         Umm, other than them, I'm trying to think, favorites.
         Um, oh, there was one back from, I guess, from the elementary years that I had forgotten to mention to you, um, Harold and the Purple Pen.
      
      
         The Purple Pen?
      
      
         Uh-huh.
         Uh, if I could get my hands on this book, I would buy it.
         It, that was a book that left a lasting impression on me.
         Harold, was, um, a little boy, and the way that this book is written, it's somebody that's drawing.
         I mean, you basically just have, you know, it's not, like, um, photo, photographic.
         It's, you know, somebody's drawing.
         Well, Harold was a draw, was one who, who drew, and he would draw things with his pen that would come alive
         .
         I don't know, there is just something about that book, that even though I haven't read it in decades, that still intrigues me, and I want to put, get my hands on it and read it again.
         Umm, as a matter of fact, when, um, oh, I guess my first radio job in VA, I, I started doing this little, um, like, anonymous gift thing?
         Like with my co-workers, I might bake something, or whatever, and I'd, I had bought a purple pen, and I would say, "The purple pen strikes again!"
         
            , and, uh,
         no one ever knew it was from Harold and the Purple Pen!
         But, or, I don't, I don't, I don't think anyone ever knew it was from me unless somebody maybe figured out my handwriting or something like that, but it was--
         
         
      
      
         That's really neat the way you did that.
         You made that connection there!
      
      
         Yeah.
      
      
         Do you always seem to have a habit of making connections in your personal life with things you have read about?
      
      
         Absolutely!
      
      
         And so you celebrate those things like you did that one?
      
      
         To some degree.
         I mean, obviously you see my Pooh stuff!
         
      
      
         That's obvious!
      
      
         To some degree, things that really have an impact on me have tended to become a part of my life on some level or another.
         I mean I may not, it may not manifest in my everyday existence, but, um, at some point or another, when it's appropriate, you know, I'll reach back and re, and connect to that book or that character or whatever or some aspect of it and bring it forward.
      
      
         I think that is really, um, putting your reading into real-life, uh, experiences and making your reading become a part of you and personalizing.
         Uh, not very many people do that.
      
      
         Really?
      
      
         And with your ability to do that, I think that that carries over into your writing.
      
      
         Hum.
      
      
         Because what you read about might spark something that becomes an interest to you, and then you carry it over into your writing.
         You might do it completely different than what the book has done--
      
      
         Um-hum.
      
      
         And just basically assimilated it into writing.
      
      
         Humm.
      
      
         Carry on that creativity into some other avenue.
      
      
         One of the recent, when I say recent, in recent years, I read a book about George Washington Carver.
         And it was incredible to me, the things that he went through, the, the, his intrigue with, um, discovering, like, all the uses for soy, a soy, the soy, the soybean, um, or peanut, or whatever.
         I mean, I went out and bought peanut oil
         just because he was, in the book it, it was saying, um, how good it was for your skin and stuff like that!
         I started in rubbing peanut oil,
         I got over it, but, and I still use it!
      
      
         You didn't get a greasy effect, did you?
      
      
         I really didn't mind the grease, it was the smell!
         
         But, um, yeah, the books that have an impact on me.
         Usually in some way, yeah, you can find little pieces of it in my life.
         And, um, my life experiences are often what end up in my writing.
         Like, um, there's a poem on the wall over there that I wrote.
         And I wrote it out of an actual experience that, um, my husband and I had.
         We went on, um, a honeymoon, well, it wasn't a honeymoon.
         A, uh, anniversary trip.
      
      
         Um-hum.
      
      
         And, um, he took me to, um, Charleston and Folly Beach, and to Isle of Palms because he knows I love the ocean.
         The Isle of Palms Beach was my favorite.
         I mean
         , every beach has a character.
         And, um, as I was walking along the beach, there were broken sand dollars.
         I mean, it was just an incredible number of broken pieces of sand dollars.
         And it was, I couldn't believe I couldn't find a whole one.
         That was, ah, my first thought, "There's got to be a whole one down here somewhere!"
         
         But, umm, then, as I was thinking about it, and I was looking at it, and, at first, I wasn't even so much interested in the broken ones.
         I was picking up the broken pieces, and it made me think about our own brokenness in our lives.
         And, umm, I don't remember whether it was that night, or, I think it was later.
         But that experience was so impacting for me that, that poem was born.
         And, um, so it was just, uh, I don't know, you don't let your experiences, whether they're experience, it's experiences that you've read or what you've lived.
      
      
         Um-hum.
      
      
         How you don't connect with it.
         I don't understand how people don't connect with it.
         But then again, maybe, in a reading, took a different, because it was an escape for me, maybe I connected with it too much!
         
      
      
         You never really escape from reading.
      
      
         Oh, not from it, no.
         Um, I enjoy visiting the different worlds, so to speak, you know, of the character or whatever.
         Whoever they were, I enjoyed walking, so to speak, with them in their life.
      
      
         Um-hum.
      
      
         Um, and um, and that's, that's still an enjoyable thing for me you know when I have the opportunity.
      
      
         Does that carry over, we've talked about you know the area in that the reading and the writing, does that carry over your love for all those things into theater as well?
      
      
         Um, I have enjoyed, um, working in theater in my youth.
         
         I don't really have much of an outlet for it now.
         Um, I guess, the, um, lack of opportunity is probably the biggest aspect of why I wouldn't now, but if I had the opportunity, I wouldn't mind.
      
      
         I guess my favorite um, one of my favorite courses in college was improvisation.
         I enjoyed doing that.
      
      
         Um-hum.
      
      
         And, um, when we were growing up, uh, our Sunday school youth group, we, we did put on plays and, and so that there was an outlet in my youth, in my younger days in college.
         But since then, um, I haven't had much of an opportunity to indulge that passion.
      
      
         What about attending theater and watching it?
         Does that do, uh, does that do very much for you?
         Or do you find that that is not the same as reading it?
      
      
         It depends.
         It depends on the story and it depends on, um, well, whether or not it's well done.
      
      
         Um-hum.
      
      
         Um, when I was in, in junior high our orchestra teacher took us to see Fiddler on the Roof.
      
      
         Um-hum.
      
      
         And that, it was a theater production, it was.
         Um, it was one that I thoroughly enjoyed and I could, you know, get right, and it is something that's one of my favorite stories, although now that I think about it, I've never read it.
         I've, you know, seen it on television, but I've never read it.
         I'll have to do that!
         
      
      
         Put it on your list!
      
      
         That's right!
         
         Fiddler on the Roof.
         Um, but, uh, I did enjoy it in the theater.
         Um, one of the plays I enjoyed reading, Lorraine-- START OF TAPE 1, SIDE B NM: Excuse me.
      
      
         That's all right.
      
      
         A Raisin in the Sun was the title?
      
      
         Yes.
      
      
         And you saw it on television?
      
      
         I've seen it on television and I've, I was interested in seeing it in, the theater, but, but I never had that opportunity.
         So if it's well done, if it's a well-written story--
      
      
         Um-hum.
      
      
         Um, I feel I would definitely enjoy.
         I have not had a lot of, other than college productions and stuff like that, uh, I haven't done a lot of theater going.
      
      
         Um-hum.
      
      
         But, um, it's, um, and I'm trying to think the theater uh, other than Fiddler on the Roof, of course I haven't seen a lot of different things, but, um, has not had the same level of impact, I guess.
         Uh, uh, going to see The Fiddler on the Roof, of course, as a violinist, that, you know, was part of our, our class, um, project, and that was part of our appreciation.
         They also had a full orchestra.
      
      
         Um-hum.
      
      
         So she wanted to expose us to that, but, uh, that has, um, remained an intriguing story partially I think because of the insight into a different culture.
      
      
         Um-hum.
      
      
         And, um, also when you think about the characters
         that are in Fiddler on the Roof, you know, they have very definite personalities!
      
      
         And there you're, again, you're drawn to personalities in writing or even acting.
         I think just from talking to you, that's a very important aspect of, of, um, your reading.
         And I think with that we can make the connection of the dictionary.
         The dictionary is a definition of a word and a personality is a definition of a person.
      
      
         Whew!
         How interesting!
         Yeah!
         I hadn't thought about that!
      
      
         Um-hum.
      
      
         Well understanding is one of the things, if I had to say that there was something underlying in my life, I've always wanted to understand, whether it was understanding people or understanding why things happen.
      
      
         Um-hum.
      
      
         Um, understand why, you know, there are times I know it must drive my husband crazy when we get to talking about
         a particular word, and I'm saying, "That doesn't mean that!"
         And he's like, well that's what it, you know, that's what it means to him and I'm like, "Well let's get the dictionary!"
         
         "We'll find out what Webster, uh, understood it to mean!"
         So we can have a common ground so we can both speak the same language and we can both, you know, know what we're talking about.
         Because different words do mean different things to different people.
      
      
         Yes.
      
      
         And, and I have found it to be a spark of misunderstanding so quickly--
      
      
         Um-hum.
      
      
         Um, that, you know, if you can get an understanding to clarify, figure out where they're coming from, and there again that personality thing--
      
      
         Yes.
      
      
         Understanding, um, a person's perspective from their personality view, you know, helps you, whether you need to make allowances for them, or, um,
         just, uh, figuring out the puzzle, you know.
      
      
         Um-hum.
      
      
         And I have to admit that there's a little bit of a Sherlock Holmes in me.
         I love figuring out puzzles!
      
      
         Um-hum.
      
      
         Whether it's life puzzles or, um, in my work, um, we
         we often find ourselves in situations where there are mysteries and we have to follow the clues.
         And I, I love, I love it when I find the answer!
         
         Everybody in the office knows!
         "I got it!"
         
      
      
         Did that ever lead you into mysteries for reading?
      
      
         Um, to some degree.
         But, um, sometimes I guess I find mysteries that leave gaps or I don't follow them quite, I don't know whether it's my perspective or my language.
         We're not on the same plane.
         And I end up not finishing it.
         
         Now I'm the kind of person, I'm very sequential, I've got to know what the end is!
         I go to the back of the book
         to find out how it ended.
         But I don't care about the middle part because somehow they lose me in the, you know, especially if they digress to other, you know, if they don't follow the story.
      
      
         Um-hum.
      
      
         They go too many different places without bringing some level of resolution to whatever the, uh, issue is that they're dealing with, you know.
         Jumping around with three different kinds of story lines, that does not appeal to me
         at all!
      
      
         Are you in the habit then, since you go to the back of the book for the mysteries, are you having to do that with the other readings?
      
      
         Um, sometimes.
         I guess it really depends on my mood.
      
      
         Um-hum.
      
      
         If, if I want to, if I really want to know how it ends and then I really want to know how they got there, then I'll do that but usually now I'm more patient.
         
         I usually just wait until I get there and see how it ends.
      
      
         Um-hum.
      
      
         If they don't end it ri ght, then I'm mad!
         
         "That's not how it should have ended!"
         Not that everything has to have a happy ending, it just has to have a, a Bible solution of, one of the things going back to The Foundation Trilogy, in their closing chap, chapters, well, it's like two chapters that end the book.
         The chapter before the last chapter is, is titled, "The Answer That Satisfies".
         And it's like the answer to the mystery that the characters are dealing with and they are satisfied with this answer.
         But then the final chapter is the answer that's real.
      
      
         Umm.
         AG: And, I don't know.
         There's something, well not only that aspect of the way that the writer, he writes, he basically gives two different endings to the story.
         You know, you could stop at the answer that satisfies and think that that's the end of the story, but then you go to the next chapter and it's like, "Ah ha!"
         
      
      
         Um-hum.
      
      
         And I do happen to love a touch of irony.
         I don't know what it is about, um, my sense of humor, which I don't have, don't have an appreciation of humor that seems like the general population has.
         Because I mean, a lot of things that people think are funny, I don't think are funny.
      
      
         Um-hum.
      
      
         And I can appreciate that they do, but personally it doesn't tickle my funny bone, but irony tickles me!
         
      
      
         Um-hum.
      
      
         Um, and one of the other things that, um, I almost had the name of the author, um, the writer of Foundation, um, that my husband and I both have taken away from that book is, um, there is a, I guess a philosophy, so to speak, of um, the, um, there are a couple of main groups in the story and the group that knows the most has a certain philosophy.
      
      
         Um-hum.
      
      
         And uh, we have seen, I guess, the essence of that truth to be, uh, applicable in real life.
      
      
         Um-hum.
      
      
         And so when a book can take a real life truth and weave it into the storyline, then, I don't know, even though it's a novel, it has a basis in reality that's intriguing.
      
      
         Um-hum.
      
      
         So, um, that's--
      
      
         Speaking of reality, you like the realism type of writing.
         We talked about the classics, you know, with Louisa May Alcott and, uh, do you, have you ever read much of the realism in modern literature which deals with realistic living and realistic lives and realistic families and the way they really are and not, something that's fictional.
         They call Cinderella-type of stories.
         These stories are pretty much what you would see today in lives of people, realism.
         Have you ever involved yourself much with the reading of that?
      
      
         When you say, "modern," do you mean like, I mean how "modern" are you talking about?
         
      
      
         I know there are degrees of modernness.
         
         I'm talking about modern in the 19th, or actually 20th century-type of reading, of novels in literature.
         They deal very much with realism, they don't like, the authors don't like the Cinderella endings, the Cinderella type of, of storyline.
         The "Father Knows Best"-types of families, you know.
         They think it's very unrealistic.
         Uh, ever involved yourself with that type of reading?
      
      
         I'm trying to remember something specific.
         I mean, I have--
      
      
         Um-hum.
      
      
         I mean because, I like to read about people's real lives.
         So from that standpoint, I would say, my answer to your question would be, "Yes."
         And I'm trying to think of something specific.
         Um, I remember um, a book, uh, this is probably in the 60s, Black Like Me.
      
      
         All right.
         OK.
      
      
         And that probably would fall into the category of reading that you're thinking about.
         Um, it was where, uh, a Caucasian man underwent a treatment where his skin color was darkened, and he experienced what it was like to be Black.
      
      
         Umm.
      
      
         And um, that had, you know, that realistic tone that you're talking about.
         And, um, I'm definitely attracted to real life stuff.
         As long as they don't get too vulgar.
      
      
         Um-hum.
      
      
         I appreciate not having to deal with vulgarity.
         I mean, you can, you can be realistic without going into great detail.
         I think about the ugliness of life.
      
      
         Um-hum.
      
      
         It's not that I think that we should gloss over, and I don't.
         But I think that you have to, um
         .
         You can tell enough of the story for people to understand without, um, mashing your face in it, so to speak.
      
      
         Um-hum.
      
      
         And, um, I, I don't have a high tolerance for violence, and, um, I, I, I recently read a book, um, it was the author's name that attracted me to it.
         I'm trying to think of the name of it.
         Aftermath was the name of the book and it was by
         .
         I don't remember his name.
         It's the gentleman that played Jordie on Star Trek.
         
         I don't know if that will mean anything to you!
      
      
         No, I didn't follow Star Trek that well!
      
      
         He also does, um, Reading Rainbow for kids.
         I cannot remember that guy's name!
         It'll come to me after while.
         Anyway it was his name that, uh, attracted me to the book and, uh, um, I've read the book, but I threw it away!
      
      
         Ooh!
      
      
         I would never want to read it again.
         It was just too graphic for me and I wouldn't have given it to anybody else.
      
      
         Um-hum.
      
      
         And I don't believe in throwing books away.
         I come from a family where you just don't throw a book away!
         It's a treasure.
         And, you know, um, I recently, as a matter of fact, had a situation where I was at my grandmother's house and in the bedroom where I was, was a book.
         I looked at it and couldn't believe that it was in her house!
         And I went to her and I was expressing my concern to her, and, um, of course, that "you don't throw away a book" came up, "But Gran!
         Some books you just have to throw away!"
         I mean, it's garbage, just garbage!
         And it wasn't something that she read.
         It was something that had come from someone who had gotten a box of books and was somebody else's library.
         So they probably didn't even know it was in the house.
         But I wasn't the only grandchild or great-grandchild that was there and I would have hated for some impressionable person to have gotten a hold of it!
         And being in grandmother's house, they would have thought it was OK!
      
      
         Umm.
      
      
         And it was horrible!
         So um--
      
      
         Was your grandmother a prolific reader?
      
      
         Very much so.
         She's, um, and probably, liked poetry, love of poetry comes from her because she would quote poetry all the time.
         And that's one of the things that is handed down from my grandmother to my mom, and, um, you know, to us and to the great-grandchildren as well.
         One of the poems that she would quote to my mom, and I don't know the whole poem but, it starts off, "I have to live with myself so I have to be fit for myself to know, um, I can't keep on the closet shelf a lot of secrets about myself I think that no one will ever know."
         That's where I get lost!
         
         But she can quote the whole thing.
         And so, yes, she definitely, um, in the, um, time where she was raising her children, it was really a, a challenge to, um, that she took on to encourage them to be their absolute best.
         And, as a matter of fact, both of her daughters became teachers.
         And, um, all of her children are, are readers.
         And, um, she definitely believed that education was a essential and, "You will go to college!"
         So that was something that was definitely handed down.
      
      
         Did she ever read stories to you?
         Or did she just quote poetry?
      
      
         
         Um, I don't know that my grandmother has ever really read a book to me.
         When I would spend time, most of the time she was working.
         I mean, she was either working for a living or she was working to take care of us.
         And she was, I can't, I don't remember a whole lot of leisure where she, now she's more leisurely.
      
      
         Um-hum.
      
      
         And one thing that we do is play Scrabble!
         
         And she still beats me!
      
      
         She does?
         !
      
      
         I can play as hard, and the best I can and she can still beat me!
         
      
      
         So she's still living?
         \\And still has her wits about her!
         \\
      
      
         \\Oh yes!
         Definitely!
         \\ And that's a real blessing.
      
      
         I can imagine that it would be.
         Now she doesn't live here?
      
      
         No.
         She's in Southerland, VA.
      
      
         Oh, OK.
      
      
         I don't, I know that she reads her Bible.
         And I know, I know that she is a reader, but actually seeing her read--
      
      
         Um-hum.
      
      
         I didn't, now my mom has piles of books
         and piles of articles, takes two papers and it's EVERYWHERE!
      
      
         Does she collect or does she read?
      
      
         She reads and she collects!
         
         And I um, try to keep my piles under control.
         
         And periodically I have to go through and I will go to like, the library book sales and I'll choose to take what piles, either the author or the title, that will interest me.
         It's only a quarter so you support the library and you buy a book and--
      
      
         Um-hum.
      
      
         And then I'll eventually get around to reading it and whether it stays or goes depends on what it's like!
         
      
      
         Yeah.
         Do you have a collection of special books?
      
      
         Oh definitely!
         Ones that I always will have and will never get rid of.
      
      
         Yeah.
         Um-hum.
      
      
         One of my, almost every year, I've got to read books.
         And since I've got one of the few non-fiction books that, uh, and again, it's based on, um, reality, is Hannah Hurnard's, Hind's Feet in High Places, and Mountains of Spices.
         And the depiction, the, the, the story that she depicts, um, is so, to me, has so many aspects of a true, the struggles of our lives, that every time I read it, because I'm a little different, I get something a little different from it.
         And that's one that I give it away, and then have to go get another copy!
         
         Because I always want that in my library.
         I always want to be able to go back and read it again.
      
      
         Uh-huh.
         I had someone give me that book once.
         Years ago.
         I probably still have it.
      
      
         Um-hum.
      
      
         So I'm familiar with that particular book.
         Um, in your high school years, you're going back to that time period and your librarian was one that you said who encouraged you and you had some challenges between each other in writing poetry--
      
      
         Um-hum.
      
      
         Um, did she, did you meet weekly or was it--
      
      
         I was in there everyday!
      
      
         Everyday?
      
      
         
         Several times I day!
         
      
      
         Now that was still during those times in high school?
      
      
         Um-hum.
         I got permission to have homeroom in the library and I then I would go there for my lunch and, I mean, I would take me like,
         that long to eat my food and I would go, "I have permission to go up to the library."
      
      
         Umm.
      
      
         And so, um, I found it kind of like being the librarian helper because I was there all the time.
         And, uh, I, as a matter of fact at one point I was going to go into Library Science.
      
      
         I was just about to ask you!
         I was surprised that you haven't become a librarian.
      
      
         Yeah.
         I toyed with it at times.
         I've worked in a couple of different church libraries and, um, I thoroughly enjoy it.
         Um, at this particular point, physically it's not something I could keep up with, but, um, the library is actually my favorite place.
      
      
         Um-hum.
         
      
      
         Other than home!
         
         Uh, well if I had my way, I'd have the library in my home!
         
      
      
         That's possible, you know.
      
      
         I know!
      
      
         You've probably collected enough books that you could fill up a room with them!
      
      
         Yep!
      
      
         Well, we have a study that we have filled, you know, you've seen our study, the books that we have.
      
      
         Um-hum.
      
      
         And I'm, I'm now with Ron's collection and mine, I'm starting to go into his area and pulling off the shelves, books that he's collected and going to read those.
      
      
         Ooh!
      
      
         Because I'm like you, you know.
         I just like to read, and I'd like to continue that.
         Are your bothers or sisters as much of a reader as you are?
         Or have an interest at all in reading?
      
      
         Oh, um
         , I think, there are six of us all together, and there's only one brother.
         To my recollection, I think all but one of my siblings is very strong in the area of reading.
         And that one sibling is, she came up at a time when they switched from phonics to sight-reading--
      
      
         Yes.
      
      
         And it crippled her to a certain degree.
         All of her life she has struggled with, um, not being able to sound out words and that it, it has really limited her in reading and it's not very much fun to her.
         But the rest of my siblings, um, are always, kind of, not so much that they're doing, I don't get the sense that they're doing so much leisure reading now, but they are, um, always, you know, continuing their education in whatever area they're studying in and their reading in that area.
      
      
         Umm.
         Interesting.
      
      
         Yeah.
         They definitely encourage their children in that regard, too.
      
      
         Um-hum.
      
      
         And so they have passed on that passion unto their children.
      
      
         That's great!
         Well, it's been real interesting, your life story about reading and writing.
         I appreciate the time!
      
      
         Oh it's my pleasure!
         Any time!
      
   

   
   
      
         This is Pat Gubbins.
         She grew up near the Coliseum, and she has some interesting stories to tell about her grandmothers.
      
      
         And with no further ado
         .
         I grew up on a 100-acre farm, which is hard to believe, now near the airport, which was not nearly as intrusive as it is now, because this was backing up to my father's parent's, who came down here from Wisconsin in 1937, looking for a Southern way of life, to get away from all that snow.
         They bought this farm off of Wilmont Road, I think it's still Wilmont Road, anyhow it's near the new Coliseum on Tyvola
         and proceeded to turn it into a working plantation, at least that was my grandmother Tina's ambition.
         My father and his brother helped them build the house, a two-story white stucco with the first oil furnace in Charlotte, or so the family history goes.
         Um.
         My father and mother met, shortly thereafter, and married in 1930, May of 1938, I think, because I came along two years later, and grew up with my grandmother Tina there, to kind of, well, I remember when I was about five years old and we had settled down for the long haul on the farm after my father finished traveling around and taking us with him to various uh, Air Force assignments out in Texas and, oh, Myrtle Beach.
         He was in the Reserves.
         So we were kind of back and forth.
         But, I think, about the time I started first grade he stopped traveling, and my little grandmother Tina, who ruled everyone with an iron hand, had been living in what we called "the big house."
         
         I'm, I'm going on too much.
         But, anyhow, moved her over to the cottage so my parents could have a little life of their own, and the little cottage was right across one of the lawns from us and her other son lived in a little house down from the cottage.
         So it was like the Borden compound
         .
         When I was in the eighth grade, uh, our savings ran out, pretty much, so my mother told, my father was being a gentleman farmer.
         During these years we raised Angus cattle and ate very well, with vegetables from the garden, but we didn't have any money.
         So my other grandmother came to live with us to take care of the children, and my mother and father both found jobs in town.
         And the two grandmothers had nothing in common but each one really gave me quite a gift.
         Grandmother Tina had traveled, uh, as the wife of a military man herself and had a real interest in adventure in other cultures, uh, the out-of-doors and I remember when I was five or six she would take me by the hand and say, "Where would you like to go for a walk?"
         and I'd point and we'd go, off in that direction--
      
      
         Wow.
      
      
         Across the fields and through the woods and over streams and I think what it did was wet my appetite for exploring new places.
         And she was so sweet to me.
         The other grandmother probably had an eighth-grade education but a fabulous mind for invention because she came up with these stories.
         When I was about seven, my mother was pregnant with my little sister, they sent me to live in Chapel Hill for six weeks toward the end of her pregnancy.
         And that grandmother was staying with my mother's brother and his family on a farm outside Chapel Hill while he was getting, uh, a PhD, and I would be homesick and my grandmother, we called her Granny, her name was Millie Frances, would make up these stories about this great white snowy owl that would carry me home to see my family.
      
      
         Oh, how neat.
      
      
         Of course if I thought about it now, I'd think of him carrying me home in his big claws
         but for a child it was very comforting.
         And then she came to live with us probably four or five years more later, while I was in the eighth grade so it would have been eight years later, and she loved gardening and flowers.
         And I think I got some of that from her because I still, whenever I'm out in the yard gardening I think about Granny, my mother's mother.
         And when I'm traveling I sometimes think about Tina and how much she would have enjoyed it.
      
      
         Well, that's a neat mix.
      
      
         Yeah.
         So--
      
      
         Did Tina ever tell you stories about her travels?
      
      
         She didn't.
         Mostly she told me stories about all the things I would inherit from her once she was gone
         .
      
      
         Did you?
      
      
         I did.
         She, she collected Chinese furniture and rugs, and that sort of thing, while they were based in Panama, and she took great pride in them.
         Pride of possession, I suppose, but also loved the thought that it would pass on to me one day.
         And I still have those things in my house.
         I have, for a poor working journalist, I have really nice furniture
         , thanks to Tina.
         And back then she bought them really cheaply because Panama was a free port, and she would get these really nice wooden, carved things from China for five, 15 dollars--
      
      
         Wow.
      
      
         That, I don't know what they'd be worth now, but I have rosewood screens that are hand-carved, that 10, 15 years ago were valued at something like 1,800 dollars apiece.
         JM: Wow.
      
      
         And the rugs are out of style but, and they're rolled up underneath our beds, for the most part.
         But it's still a nice reminder of her.
         At first I kind of resented having to take all this stuff because it meant I could never decorate the way I wanted to decorate, but I got over that, and realized you can have an eclectic mix of stuff.
         And it's nice to have some good pieces of furniture that have that history attached to them.
         And the other grandmother had nothing really of her own to leave us, except a rocking chair that I think was her mother's.
         It's not real comfortable, but it has a place of honor in our kitchen.
      
      
         Hum.
         That's neat.
         Um, did they both live with you until they died?
      
      
         Uh.
         Granny did.
         She got senile, a couple of years before she died and I had graduated from college and my mother was taking care of her and my father had died and we kept her at home and under control with Thorazine.
         And I remember a terrible time when my mother had gone to the grocery store and had left me, I was there for the weekend home from, I worked in Shelby or Gastonia at the time.
         Uh, it was a time Granny had missed her medication, and she was getting strange.
         She got real agitated.
         She'd see bugs crawling up the wall.
         And I tried to make her take her pill, and she hit me and I hit her back.
         Not hard, but it just shocked me that I would do such a thing.
      
      
         Probably shocked her too.
      
      
         It shocked her, and she took her pill
         .
         And settled down
         .
         And the other grandmother had a series of strokes, and my poor mother, who was widowed,
         was she widowed then?
         No, she was widowed shortly after Tina died, uh, but my father was working and my mother, I think, was kind of in charge of finding housekeepers to take care of Tina, who loved nothing better than to order people around.
         She was hard to get along with, and people would quit, and Mom would rehire them, or Tina would fire them, and Mom would rehire them, and she finally wound up at the Huntersville, at what's now the Huntersville Oak--
      
      
         Yeah.
      
      
         I think.
         And I was in college when she died.
         But she was artistic.
         That's something else I got from her, I forgot.
         Back in the twenties, no, the turn of the century, ladies painted, hand-painted china.
         It was the thing for women of leisure to do.
         She was not a woman of leisure but she always fancied being that, so she would get this, this, barrels of fine china and hand-paint them and fire them and initial them.
         She insisted I be named for her so I could inherit her monog- rammed stuff.
         She was Kathryn Petric Borden - Petric was short for Petrechek.
         She was from Czecho, her parents were from Czechoslovakia, and that was her maiden name, but it was shortened to Petric when they came over here.
         So she was Kathryn Petric Borden, and so my mother had no choice in the matter - I had to be Kathryn.
         Well, she had the choice of the middle name but it had to start with a P and she thought about Penelope but luckily settled on Patricia Borden.
         So here I have all these monogrammed linen napkins that sit in this, uh, pigskin trunk that was hand-painted by my grandmother Tina, with a brass clasp.
         It's from China too.
         And lots of this hand-painted china--
      
      
         Huh.
      
      
         That Anne and I split up when she died.
         She didn't specify who would get what, and when she died and the time came to settle up stuff, Mom said, "Ok, how are you and Anne going to do this?"
         And so we said, "We'll flip a coin and see who goes first."
         So that's how we did, Anne would pick something, and then I would pick something, and then if one of us would pick something the other really wanted we'd work it out and so that was--
      
      
         You two were the only two grandchildren?
      
      
         Um huh.
         No, uh, she left things to two other grandchildren.
         Her other son had a son and a daughter by two different marriages.
         And I guess they
         um, I don't know how they figured that out because I wasn't around when that was settled, but I know that they, we all got something like $1,500 plus furnishings.
         Stuff.
         They each got stuff I didn't even know about.
         Until recently, when I went up to see my cousin Cindy and she unrolled this wall hanging, this thick rug, that was hand-woven, of the 12 immortals.
         And it's in pristine condition.
         My sister has the matching one, and Cindy has this Western-type log house and said, "This rug, it, there's nowhere to put it."
         They had things like stuffed animals on their walls.
         Her husband's a big game hunter--
      
      
         Oh, you mean like stuffed heads of animals?
      
      
         Yeah, yeah.
      
      
         So what did she do with the rug?
         Did she give it to you?
      
      
         Uh huh, and now it's under another of my beds at home
         .
         It's really beautiful but maybe one day I'll have a bigger house with a bigger wall that I can put it on.
         I don't know, sometimes possessions can be a real burden.
      
      
         But that's neat she wanted you to have her stuff, and I mean she--
      
      
         Oh yeah.
      
      
         She planned that.
      
      
         Oh yeah she did.
         But I really got tired of her talking about the day when she passed on and I would get all these things.
         I thought of it as kind of emotional blackmail in a way, but years later I don't really think it was.
         She was just, she was wanting to establish that connection even after she was gone.
         She really, well, both our grandmothers just were the best you could have.
         They never criticized us, and they spoiled us.
      
      
         That's what grandparents are for.
      
      
         Yeah.
      
      
         Why did you call her Tina though?
         From Kathryn--
      
      
         My mother came up with that nickname.
         It has nothing to do with her name.
         She, uh, all the other relatives called her Kathryn, or Aunt Kathryn, or whatever, but, I guess because she's little or was little, maybe Tina kind of sounded like teeny
         .
         I asked my mother how she came up with it, and she said she didn't know, it just kind of fit her, and so from then on she was Tina.
         
      
      
         Hum.
      
      
         I would never have thought to call her Granny, she wasn't the "granny" type.
         Whereas my other grandmother, who used snuff, and was very, very religious to the point of being a fanatic, uh, was a perfect granny.
         My mother made her cotton dresses that came down below her calf, and she wore these shoes that are now in vogue, the black--
      
      
         The granny shoes.
      
      
         Granny shoes.
         And cotton stockings.
         And a pretty little apron.
         She always wore an apron.
         She did a lot of cooking for us.
         She made great fried apple pies.
         Oh.
         And wonderful skillet cornbread.
         Those are the things I most remember about her cooking.
         But it was sad when she started to lose her memory because she would pull up plants out of season.
         She'd still want to garden and things would be coming up and she would think it was time to pull them out.
         You'd have to kind of go behind her and say, "Whoa"
         .
         But she was a, she was a sweetheart, they both were in their own ways.
         And of course you never appreciate them and think to ask them stories--
      
      
         Yeah.
      
      
         Like, until it's too late.
         Because I know my Granny grew up in Cabarrus County on a farm and was one of three or four kids, and she inherited her father's mother for a season out of every year.
         Poor old woman would come all wrapped up in layers of clothes, and my mother told me this not long before she died, but she said when she was little she remembered her granny showing up and her mother saying, "The first thing I'm going to do is unwrap this cocoon."
         
         She wouldn't have changed her clothes since the last time Granny had seen her probably--
      
      
         Oh no.
      
      
         Well maybe six months.
         But she had just layers and layers and it was just, I can imagine her just grabbing it and going, "bloop,"
         and throwing all that in the wash pot and getting her cleaned up.
         She was an ugly woman.
         She was great big and looked very sour
         , but, uh,
         they all had stories of their own.
         I don't, now, let's see which one was it, I'll tell you this one last story because it's a great story going back to the Civil War.
         And it might have been this very woman, who, when she was a little girl, this would be my great-grandmother,
         Maryann Joyner, uh, her father went off to fight in the war, on the Confederate side, from Cabarrus County.
         And he didn't come back, which left her mother kind of in limbo.
         They presumed dead, the war ended, he never came back, they never learned what happened to him, and so she took up with this, I guess he was a traveling salesman, with a wagon and a mule.
         And she put her two children, Maryann and her little brother, Maryann was about 12 and her brother was about eight at this point, and they took, they moved down, or were going to move down to Georgia.
         But he, what happened?
         I think they both died
         of malaria, which was pretty prevalent along the coastal area, and left the two kids on their own.
         Maryann took her little brother by the hand and they walked back to Concord.
      
      
         Wow.
         PG: And were taken in by this old man, older man, who was probably, I guess, 40's, early 50s maybe, who had a sick wife and a flock of kids.
         He brought them in, took her in, I guess both of them, with the understanding she would take care of his wife and the kids.
         Well, the wife died, and he married Maryann.
      
      
         Huh?
      
      
         So, I don't know what the age difference was but it was probably 30, 35 years.
      
      
         Wow.
      
      
         And she had several kids by him.
      
      
         Wow.
         That is an interesting story.
      
      
         Yeah, I tried to get my mother, well I did have my mother on tape te lling about it and then I lost the tape
         .
         But there's so many things like that I wish I had known to ask both grandmothers.
         Because on the other side, of course, they fought with the Yankees
         .
         My grandfather's father or maybe my grandfather's grandfather, uh, fought in the Civil War and he was captured and went to
         , what's that awful prison in South Carolina?
         Uh--
      
      
         I know what you're talking about.
      
      
         That a book was written about--
      
      
         I can't remember the name.
      
      
         But, anyway, he survived it.
         A lot of people didn't, um, and he walked back to Wisconsin.
      
      
         Wow.
      
      
         No, I take that back.
         They were living in Pennsylvania, and he walked back from Charleston area to Pennsylvania after the war, like so many other people had to do because there was no other way to get there.
         
         Andersonville!
      
      
         That's it.
      
      
         Yeah.
         That takes it back, the little bits I know about the family.
         That's back about as far back as I can go.
         Except for, well, there's my grandmother Tina, who grew up in Wisconsin in the central part of the state while it was still Indian territory, and you know, you know the dining table at my house.
         Have I told you the story about it?
      
      
         No
      
      
         It was her mother's table, and chairs, and it was the table that she would put all her weekly baking on every Monday, for the family.
         She was widowed fairly young and had these nine kids.
         And she took in laundry and raised her family as best she could.
         My grandmother Tina was like the youngest of these kids and she was, I guess, eight or nine when this happened, but they, everybody, I mean the Indians were part of the community, although they kind of kept to themselves, but they knew what was going on and they would have dealings with the settlers.
         Well, my grandmother Tina, who was a little girl, got sick with some fever, and her mother was staying up with her night and day and was just exhausted.
         And the Indians, some of the Indians knew about it, and they said, they said to Tina's mother, "You go get some sleep.
         We'll take care of your little girl."
         So they brought her some sort of herbal concoction and broke her fever and she got better and they went away.
         And they came back the next Monday, after the baking was done, and they gathered up the four corners of the tablecloth and took the week's worth of baking, out the door, which they figured was their due
         .
      
      
         Without saying a word?
      
      
         Yeah.
      
      
         Wow, you have any idea what year that was
         ?
         Can you trace it back?
      
      
         
         Yeah, it would have been, let's see, my father was born in 1904.
         Tina would have been about 20, early 20s at that point, so
         early--
      
      
         1885?
      
      
         Yeah, thereabouts
         .
         It was truly the wild frontier
         .
      
      
         And here you are.
      
      
         And here I am, eating off that table
         .
         Things have calmed down pretty much since then.
      
      
         Well, I don't know, sometimes--
      
   

   
   
      
         ( )
      
      
         Yeah OK.
         This is Clifford Hebard with interview one.
      
      
         You're doing more than one interview?
      
      
         Yeah I have to do three.
      
      
         Oh.
         OK.
      
      
         All right, go ahead.
         Tell us about Disney World.
      
      
         All right, well thank you for asking Melissa
         .
         Disney World.
         Disney World is, uh, is one of my favorite, favorite family stories, and one of the reasons why it's my favorite family story is because we had been there, I think just once, when you guys were real little, uh, no when you were two we took you back.
         You know this story?
      
      
         Yes.
      
      
         You do?
         Mmm OK, so anyhow, I remember it was really, really hot and it was real crowded.
         It was really crowded and, uh, and we got there and we didn't really know what to do, what to do first, so we sort of had different groups.
         It was sort of the crazy ride group.
         That was Mark and ( ) and Mark and Kim and me, and then there was the grandparents group that would sort of, you know, stay in the shadows and take it easy because it really was hot.
         And then there was the kids' ride group headed by you.
         So you and Mom spent a lot of time on the, uh, merry- go-round.
         I forget, Mom lost count how many times you were on that merry-go-round because you were too little.
      
      
         I thought I rode the Small World.
      
      
         You did.
         You did and this is what
         you did the rest of the time you were at Disney World.
         So you rode the merry-go-round and we'd go back and meet you every once in a while and you were having a great time.
         We didn't care, and the merry-go-round was, uh, was as good as it got for you.
         You know, big smile, bouncing around.
         And then we started looking, uh, for other rides as we all got back together and we took you to, uh, I forget which other ones we went to, the little helicopters, I'm sure, and some of the other fun rides, the little boats and that sort of thing, and then we saw Small World and I had no idea what it was like because I had never heard of it, but this is a Disney classic, this is the best ride they have, in a sense makes, Disney makes Disney what it is.
         And we all climbed into this boat and I'm climbing into a boat thinking, "Who wants to do this?"
         We got in and there was lots of people around and we took, you know, we took a half an hour to get there because the line was really long, and finally, we were in the boat.
         This little two year old perched in the front on the boat, you know, on the bow just floating around, and I remember you were pretty quiet, you didn't really say too much.
      
      
         Dad I didn't say you could talk about me during the interview
         .
      
      
         Well hey, I'm in charge here.
         I'm the storyteller.
         I'm just getting started.
      
      
         Yeah OK good
         .
      
      
         Uh, so then we, then you go through all these passage ways and you come into this, um, this long stretch where all of a sudden it's this like this big long cave and it's all, there's stuff all around the walls and there are, uh, and there are all these little tiny action figures little dolls and so on jumping up and making faces and all that kind of stuff, and singing and the music is, uh
         .
         So anyway, along we came into this big cavern and there were these big dolls and bright colors and trains just kind of lurching through this, this water.
         It was really cool actually and I don't remember when it started because all of us were kind of looking around but somebody said, "Look at Melissa!"
         And there's this little two year old just frozen.
         Your mouth was open your eyes were bigger than I'd ever seen and just staring at everything.
         And through the whole trip you never really moved.
         I mean once in a while, you'd laugh or you'd giggle and we stopped watching this great ride, just watched you.
         It was just so much fun, it was like, it was like the best that Disney could be, at just the perfect time for a little kid.
         We've been to Disney, I think three or four times total, but that's like my all time favorite one, a really good time.
         Probably a close tie with, uh, Space Mountain, who Kim and Mark, that was fun too, but, um, yeah those are our, um.
         OK so what else do you want me to talk about?
         
         So another story that comes to mind is summer family vacation, and one of my favorite was in, uh, Roger's Rock, up in the, uh, Adirondacks.
         How old you would have been?
         You was about, oh boy, gosh.
         I, I would say, your Mom and I were in our late thirties and you were um, um well anyway, it doesn't matter.
         Um, so we went to Roger's Rock, you know, family camping, and this is not your mom's idea of the ultimate vacation.
         Uh it kind of was mine, but, uh, your mom wasn't so sure, but we had really nice weather.
         And we were there for a week, and we had the old, uh, the old blue, the old blue tent, you remember?
         The huge one with the three rooms and the, the holes in the top that we fixed and everything, that, that your mom is keeping it.
         And we had a great time.
         We went to the beach, did some shopping, I think, and exploring, but then, uh, I think the next to last night, we decided to have a special like, a special camping, end of camping trip dinner and we got everything all going.
         We were going to be grilling and everything, making beets on the stove, lobster or something, and barbecuing and all that.
         And after three days of the best weather we'd ever had, the clouds just opened up and it started raining and it was raining really hard.
         I remember thinking, "Boy it can't rain any harder than this," because we were sitting there with rain pounding all around us, and, you know, everything we owned getting wet and the tent soaking through sleeping bags getting wet.
         And then it really started to rain.
         I mean that was just a warm up.
         You could barely see.
         I mean the air was white; it was amazing.
         And I remember your mom sort of sitting in the car looking at me, and I don't know what you kids were doing, probably sitting in the car with her and I'm standing out there in the rain.
         I just I didn't want to leave.
         I didn't want vacation to end.
         And so here everyone is in the car, I think with the door open or the window at least, watching me and I'm standing there in the rain hoping it would end, not wanting to give up on my vacation or yours.
         And I remember that it had rained so hard that the boiling water in the campfire that was cooking the beets had cooled down, and I really like beets, and I
         I remember the beets were sort a floating to the top and I remember, it was sort of like this cave man moment, I looked at the beet, thought about it for a minute, reached in, kind of picked it up like an apple, and thought, "This looks good."
         And so I took, took a big bite, and I remember looking over at Mom, and I don't know what she did, but, uh, all of a sudden the signal got clear.
         I think the car we had was one of those old station wagons.
         The Vega, remember that one?
      
      
         Uh-huh.
      
      
         So we threw open the back of the Vega and took all our camping stuff, everything.
         We didn't even pack it we just wadded it, just mushed it all up running around this incredible torrential rain, shoved it into the back of the car and, uh, went home one night early.
         So I don't think it was a huge concession.
         Yeah, well we got, we got rained on enough that it could have been worse.
         Uh they say this skips a generation too, so this could be your future.
      
      
         Oh really.
      
      
         Yeah Grandpa and Grandma Hebard, whenever we went camping, every single time it rained, it rained hard.
         The whole time I was growing up I can think of one sunny vacation and that's it.
         So that's a vacation story.
         That must be about 10 minutes right?
      
      
         Almost.
      
      
         Almost, OK, so what else would you like me to--
      
      
         Whatever you want.
      
      
         Oh golly.
         Other, other stories.
         I'm trying to think what else I could tell you about.
         Well I could tell you about my worst skiing trip ever.
      
      
         OK.
      
      
         OK, this was in the summer because ski trips in the summer aren't good.
      
      
         No.
      
      
         This was in a place you may see some day called Zoar Valley it's in, uh, where is it?
         Cattaraugus County, which is the next county down from Erie County, which is where Buffalo is.
         And so, that was the place where Andy and Mom and Saul, the guys and I would all go in high school on weekends and usually we would just go to, uh, to walk along the path because it's a huge, uh, it's got Cattaraugus County Creek down at the bottom of it, it's got great big shale cliffs with lots of really loose shale on it and usually we'd walk along the stream bank and go swimming and jump off cliffs, that sort of thing.
         But once we decided to climb it, it didn't look too tough to climb up, so we thought, "What the heck, let's give it a shot."
         Andy and I did this, and actually, I think we climbed down from the top.
         It was fairly shallow, a fairly, uh, fairly shallow angle for about, oh I don't know, two or three hundred yards, and then we couldn't see over the edge down to the creek which was like way down there.
         This little ribbon of water.
         So we climbed up part way down and it was like walking in, uh, in a, in a great big pile of ball bearings, you know?
         It was like really loose.
         It was like, almost like it was snow.
         It would crunch under your feet, it got really dusty, you know, it wasn't like earth at all.
         And because it was slanted, you'd slide on it a little bit and about 15 steps into it we looked at each other.
         We both like skiing and went skiing, "Let's ski this stuff," and in a little while we went, "Yeah, you can probably see what's coming here."
         Uh, I didn't go over the edge by the way.
         So we both started skiing, and we're pretty good skiers.
         We were jumping up and down and pretending we were parallel skiing back and forth and leaping up in the air in big clouds of dust, and it was really fun, and Andy finally quit.
         He got tired and I thought I'd go a little farther and I skied a few more steps and somehow one of us had dislodged a fairly good size rock, which I had no idea was bouncing down the hill toward me.
         And I'm skiing away having a great time and once when I came up, I remember, I can still remember I came up in mid air and I was as high up off the shale as you could get making my next turn, and "Wham!"
         this rock smacks right into my hip.
         It didn't hurt, I wasn't injured, but it hit me in just the right place so that it knocked me right over and all the sudden I was like running, like I had completely lost my balance and I'm running down this shale as fast as I can, which is fine normally.
         The problem is, uh, you can run forever because you hit this drop off and the drop is a sheer, probably a hundred feet or more straight down to the creek.
         
         So I was running down as fast as I can to get there so I could drop off the end.
         And I remember thinking, "I can't do this."
         
         And on and on we went and all I remember is it was getting closer and I really couldn't figure out a way.
         I would try and fall down and I'd sort of bounce up again and, uh, you almost didn't get to be my daughter because of this, this was really close.
      
      
         What?
      
      
         I was kind of, well I this was really dangerous as it turned out, and I wasn't sure what I was going to do.
         I would fall down and slide and somehow get bounced back up.
         I didn't have an answer, and little did I know, the answer was right behind me.
         It wasn't Andy, he was watching all this thinking, "This is it."
         So, I was getting pretty close.
         Another rock that we had knocked loose up above was bouncing down behind me and it caught me again.
         It just smacked me right down into the shale like a big hand just pushing me right down into this loose dusty shale and hard enough so I sank in a little bit.
         I was dug in with my fingers and my toes and began to slide on my face instead of running and slide down more and more, and I stopped and as the, over the years, I think the distance from the drop off where I stopped gets closer and closer
         in about eight inches, approximately.
         I don't know, it could have been 50 yards, it could have been 10 feet, but it was too close whatever it was.
         And I remember sitting there and kind of looking down at the edge for a moment going, "Whoa!
         That could have been it."
         That's, I think that's the closest I ever came, the most dangerous thing that ever happened to me, but the good news was it was easy to walk to the top.
         It just took a while, so turned back around, sort of crawled through this shale listening to Andy yell insults from up above.
      
      
         What's shale?
      
      
         Shale is a really loose flat rock like you see next to streams sometimes.
         Um, you can like break off a layer of it, sort, it's like stratified.
      
      
         Oh.
      
      
         You know, the skipping rocks you can kind of break up?
         It's, it's like that.
         It's a metamorphic rock, so it's made out of mud and it sort of gets created by the pressure of the water over thousands of years, so it's really kind of a loose kind of rock, and the shale, that huge shale that we were skiing over had broken off up above on the shale crest and sort of collected.
         And so we were skiing in big piles of loose rock, was what it came down to.
      
      
         That's crazy.
      
      
         Yeah it was great, so.
         But happily, you, the fact that you have a father, you owe to a rock.
      
      
         Yeah really.
         All right well that's probably enough that's about 15 minutes.
      
      
         Is that 15?
         OK you sure?
      
      
         Yeah thank you very much.
      
      
         You're welcome.
      
   

   
   
      
         This is Candace Walton.
         I'm interviewing Debra Hicks on November 24, 1999, and she is going to tell us a story that she remembers from her childhood.
      
      
         The story I'm about to tell is about this little girl.
         Ah, she grew up in a interracial family background.
         Um, she had very big dreams of wanting to become a lawyer one day.
         Um, she, was, at the time, there was a lot of racial tension that was going on, so she felt like she wouldn't be able to make it.
         She was kind of confused of what background she wanted to u-, what ethnic background she wanted to use, so she decided to use her black heritage, um background.
         And so she moved to New York and she went to school there, she made it through school and she did become a attorney.
         She later was going through problems because they found out that she was a black ethnic and not white, so they would, she could no longer work with the firm.
         Um, they had no sufficient reason as to why they wanted to cancel, didn't want her to be, um, the attorney.
         Um, so they told her she wasn't doing good with her cases, so she decided finally, she left the firm.
         She got married and she married this, uh, very predominant guy who's very, very well-off and they moved back to their, her hometown in GA.
         So she decided that she would go and visit her grandmother who raised her, and her grandmother was telling how she told her it would be hard and for her to make it once she let it known that she was an African, Afro-American.
         So she decided that she would start an organization, and I can't remember the name of it, to where, it has something to do with women's, um, Women's Black American, Women's something and, to, she, um, let me see what else.
         She, um, she, um, oh, started this organization.
         She started the organization and I can't remember the name of the organization and, um, she helped out a lot of, of women that uh, that were black women that were having problems being able to make it in society because of their, their color or their culture background.
         And, um, let's see she didn't she, her grandmother passed away and she, um, after her grandmother passed away, she moved from GA, her and her husband, she did have a child and, um, so she moved back to New York, and she, uh, after she finished helping with this, um, women organization, um, she went back into law practice.
         That's about all I can remember of this story.
         I read this story and it was a very good story and, um, it was just meaningful and touching that how, you know, we as, as individuals can criticize our own color because of being a little shade lighter or hair is straighter than your hair or whatever.
         But I really enjoyed it and I got a lot of good insight points on it.
      
      
         So it was a book that you read?
      
      
         It, actually it started out as a story that I had to do for a, my senior project, senior exit.
      
      
         Oh!
         So y'all made it up?
      
      
         We made the story up, but actually the story, there was story very similar, um, same name everything.
         Everything was the same except our name wasn't
         in the copyright nowhere but, ah, it was a story an actual truthful story.
      
      
         OK well thank you very much for sharing \\ your story \\ with me.
      
      
         \\ You're welcome \\.
      
   

   
   
      
         Okay, this is Paul Martini.
         Ah, it's ah April 14th at about six o'clock on Friday and we're here with Sam Hodges and he's going to tell us a story he heard ah when you were a child, is that right?
      
      
         Yeah, basically when I was a child.
      
      
         And how old were you when you heard the story?
      
      
         Umm, I'd say I was in actually Cub Scouts at the time so I guess that would put me about probably about, about eight or nine.
      
      
         Eight or nine that's--
      
      
         So--
      
      
         // Pretty long time ago huh?
         //
      
      
         // So this was this was in the mid, um this was late, late 1970s about `78.
         //
      
      
         Cool.
         And, uh, Sam, ah, is a resident of Charlotte for 11 years and he was born in Durham and he is, um, he's a Caucasian male banker who has education of BS in international business and um I think we're ready for the story now.
      
      
         Okay, good, um.
      
      
         Uh-huh.
      
      
         The story actually started out and I heard it first when, when I was growing up as a kid but as I mentioned earlier Cub Scouts were actually out camping so it's definitely a story.
      
      
         Uh-huh.
      
      
         It's a horror story no doubt so you have to picture the setting that it's around.
      
      
         Uh-huh.
      
      
         Um, I was about eight, um, um we were out camping in the back basically in the back of a friend of mine's house in Orange County.
      
      
         Uh-huh.
      
      
         Which is the county right next to where I lived.
         He basically they had basically woods outdoors and there were parents there with us but we were only eight so we're learning how to camp um we actually slept that night in a tee-pee, uh, uh an original tee-pee that uh were used by Native Americans at one time, sort of as a historical artifact.
         So we're getting ready for bed, we've eaten dinner, we're around the campfire, and the owner of the property, it's Dwayne Hobgood, I guess I can say his name.
      
      
         Uh-huh.
      
      
         Um says, "Boys I've got a story for you.
         ''
      
      
         
            
         
      
      
         Now picture this.
         There's about six or seven of us, little kids, eight-years old, this is a man that's going to be giving a good story.
      
      
         
         Right.
         And we'll take a little break here while we answer the cell phone.
         Do you want to hear or do you want to keep?
         
      
      
         Where was I before we were interrupted?
      
      
         The uh, you were uh, Hobgood's property and.
      
      
         OK.
      
      
         A bunch of kids are listening and he's got boys I've got a story for you now.
      
      
         "Eh boys, I've got a story for you," and we're sitting around the campfire he goes, "Gentlemen let me tell you the story of Two Feathers."
         He goes, "Two Feathers was," and this time political correctness wasn't.
      
      
         
            Right.
      
      
         Wasn't par for the course wasn't nomenclature.
         He said, "Boys I've got this story about an Indian for you.
         His name is, ah, Two Feathers.
         He grew up in Orange County," or what was Orange County it wasn't named Orange County at the time.
         Um and act and he says, "Two Feathers was, um, once again was an Indian who, uh, lived there back before, before it was settled by the Europeans."
         He says Two Feathers grew up, he hunted he fished bas, basic, the basic Indian life um until one day when he was about 20, 25 he was out hunting and he was hunting a mountain lion.
         He came across a mountain lion.
      
      
         Uh-huh.
      
      
         And um they got into a tussle.
      
      
         Uh-huh.
      
      
         He stabbed the mountain lion a few times, the mountain lion bit him a few times.
      
      
         Uh-huh.
      
      
         They struggled back and forth struggled back and forth.
         Finally the mountain lion ripped off his arm his left arm.
      
      
         Uh-huh.
      
      
         And, uh, takes off with it, goes.
         So he doesn't know but he, he doesn't die he survives um and grows old becomes an old, old, an old Indian and, um, um, becomes you know one of the leaders of the tribe but he's always got this one goal is to find that mountain lion that got his arm and really he doesn't really care that much about the mountain lion he wants his arm or somebody's arm.
      
      
         Right.
         
      
      
         So, um, time goes on and, um, he dies but he comes back as a ghost.
      
      
         OK.
      
      
         Um, and what happens is as the settlers move in, he actually finds um, because he doesn't want to take people, you know, from his own tribe's arm but he needs an arm so he's spending all of eternity hunting for his arm and, um, as, you know, time comes on and the settlers start in, the region settlers.
      
      
         Uh-huh.
      
      
         Um, one day one guy wakes up in the morning; he's bleeding; he felt like he doesn't have an arm and he sees this ghost of an Indian.
      
      
         Uh-huh.
      
      
         He's got his arm and uh he's trying to put it on his body and it didn't fit and it's too short and it didn't look like his arm so he throws it aside and goes on.
         Um, this happens all throughout history and he was telling us how it keeps going on and on.
      
      
         
            
         
      
      
         And you know as an adult it's not, it's, you know, he, it's a good story but as an eight-year-old kid you're worried about your arm.
      
      
         That's right.
         
      
      
         And because he usually catches people not in their house but when they're out camping or sleeping.
      
      
         In a tee-pee right.
         
      
      
         In a tee-pee yeah.
         So.
      
      
         
            
         
      
      
         He tells us his story, he says, you know, "You've got to watch out for your arm.
         Spend the night," um, you know, "because if he comes his name's Two Feathers," but there's a chant, um, in regards to you know to getting him away and it goes something like, "Two Feathers be gone I want my arm!
         ''
      
      
         
            
         
      
      
         Um and there's also other things you can do to deter him.
         You can also, um, in front of your tee-pee you have to stack stones in a certain manner in order to say, "Hey I'm a friend and not a foe, I'd like to keep my arm."
      
      
         
            
         
      
      
         So he proceeds to have us, um, build the stones and, um, you know, learn the chant, we're chanting, and sends us off to bed.
         Now we all spend the whole night staying awake listening for Two Feathers.
         "Two Feathers is coming, Two Feathers is coming.
         '' He would do that to us in the night.
         "Two Feathers is coming."
      
      
         That's terrible.
         
      
      
         
         Uh, so you have eight scared boys that are Two Feathers.
         Now I don't know if this actually applies as a story I heard sort of an embellishment on this story in regards to I give you the details but.
      
      
         Uh, a good campfire, um.
      
      
         It's a good campfire story, um, so it's, I guess something to start with.
      
      
         Yep that's good.
      
      
         Um.
      
      
         Yeah, that's about 15 minutes I'd say.

         This is Jennifer House.
         Um, some remembrances of growing up in the Charlotte area.
         Um, I'm going to share a few little stories I remember, uh, happened at Christmas time.
         I remember my dad telling a funny story about my brother, my oldest brother, and they had purchased this huge like little general store type thing that had all these, um, boxes and cartons and stuff that you would put together, and, um, it was actually like a little store-front thing.
         Well they lived in a really small, tiny, little apartment.
         And they had spent all night with a couple of friends of theirs
         , assembling all of these toys and boxes, and, you know, the stickers on the boxes.
         And then, um, Christmas morning my oldest brother woke up and was sick and my younger brother had the, um, measles, and was sick and screaming and crying, and they had the house full of all these little boxes and things from this, uh, toy store that had been put up.
         And it was so miserable and the house was so crowded and the kids were so wild that by Sunday by that Christmas afternoon they had taken everything down and boxed everything back up again just to get it out of the way just because they, uh, were so miserable that Christmas because my brother had been so sick.
         Um, another time, this was for the, um, other brother, um, the one that had been sick as a baby, they bought him, one year, all this um cowboy and Indian stuff, and again all this assembly was required, and, um, the same friends that had helped put together all the boxes a few years earlier for my other brother, um, had come over and they had to put all these decals and stickers on everything and then had to individually dress all the different Indians, and, um cowboys and you know the tiny guns and the little itty-bitty tiny holsters that they had to put around the waist of all the different cowboys, and, uh, then, you know, all the little, um, suits and headdresses and everything that had to go on all the little Indians and the horses and the saddles and all this kind of stuff.
         And Dad said they were up till like four o'clock in the morning getting all this stuff put together and were just exhausted and about dead.
         And then, um, of course, you know, both of my brothers woke up about five a.m.
         or something
         , so they just absolutely didn't get any sleep at all.
         Um, and it was just another miserable Christmas, I think, because they were so tired.
         And, you know, I think by the end of the day my brother had lost half the toys, and, you know, half the little pieces and all this kind of stuff and, um, it was very frustrating, um.
         Then I remember, um, one Christmas for me, um, I had been begging and begging for like this, uh, Barbie-head thing that you could, you know, put makeup on and style the hair and all this kind of stuff, and, um, my dad worked, uh, for a textile company.
         He was an engineer, and he, um, had to travel around to lots of different mills and stuff, and so, um, everywhere he had been he just could not find this Barbie-head thing, you know, and it was just you know getting closer and closer to the time and he was starting to panic.
         And so finally, you know, some little town that, you know, he had had to go to, um, he found one, um, in a store.
         And so that was my big Christmas present well when I put makeup on her, um, it just wouldn't even rub off, I mean it was just like this, you know, permanent stuff that you couldn't even smudge off or wash off even with soap and water.
         It just absolutely would not come off, and so it was like one time and you were done and that was it.
         And I remember being so disappointed and my dad was just furious.
         I mean he was ready to kill me because I, you know, didn't play with it anymore the rest of the day.
         And I kept trying to tell him, "Well," you know, "The makeup is not coming off."
         You know, "Nothing is smudging off and I can't redo her makeup because it's on there and," you know, "It's not coming off."
         And, oh, he was just furious.
         
         He probably would have sold me to the highest bidder at that point or maybe even the lowest bidder to just get rid of me.
         Um, and, um, I remember another time, um, being told about a time when the family was up in the mountains.
         We had this place that we would go to and they called it our rock.
         But it was near, um, on the way to Chimney Rock, I think, and it was just off the side of the road and, and where the river was and there was a great big old flat rock that sort of jutted out into the river and, um, we would go up there, you know, occasionally on the weekends and have like a picnic and stuff on the rock.
         And, um, to the side of the rock there was like a little pool where the water wasn't too swift and you could, um kind of play around.
      
      
         
         Classes, may I have your attention?
      
      
         Um, and so there was an area that you could swim in, you know, to the one side.
         But in front of the rock on, you know, the other three sides of this big rock the river was very swift.
         And I remember them telling me one time, um, that my youngest, well not youngest but the younger brother, the one in the middle, um, had just, you know, jumped off into this swift- moving river, and, um he was always quite the daredevil, and still is, even in his 40s, um but he just decided he wanted to go swimming in the deep water and he jumped off.
         Well, you know, he immediately was swept down the river.
         And, um, then my oldest brother he's the hero and the rescuer, and so, well, he jumps in.
         So now here's both his sons in the river getting swept down.
         So then, of course, my dad had to jump in and, uh, fortunately for them, no one was, you know, smashed against another rock or anything like that.
         Um, and they he finally caught up with the two boys and got them out.
      
      
         
         Staff, may I have your--?
      
      
         And he caught, uh, he managed to catch both my brothers, and, uh they got to the side of the river, and so, of course, now, you know, my mother I think, um, was pregnant with me at the time.
         So here she's standing on this rock, you know, about to burst with a baby and, you know, screaming and crying because all three of her family members are getting swept away in this river.
         But they, uh, finally got out and managed to make their way back up to the rock.
         But that was, you know, a very traumatic event.
         Um, I remember another time, uh, being told, uh, about a storm that had come up that my dad had taken, um, my two brothers, and, um, I can't remember if I was with them or not.
         I think I was.
         I think I was around at that time.
         My brothers are quite a bit older than me, um, and I think I was young and, um, he had taken us, and I don't know, maybe a few other of the neighborhood kids, and my mother was at, uh, choir practice at that time at the church, and so he had the rest of us like at a little park that was down the street.
         And, uh, all of a sudden one of these, you know, really fast, violent summer storms came up and, um, everybody was just petrified.
         And he said somebody had like, I don't know, a little drum or a stick or something I can't remember.
         So he says, we ended up underneath one of the shelters and that was the only, you know, shelter in this whole park because it was all wide open.
         So we have all these kids and my dad underneath this big shelter and we were marching around the picnic table singing and, you know, marching and letting the thunder kind of be like the cymbals, you know, of a marching band.
         And just, um, he said he didn't, he didn't have any idea how many laps we did around that table but it was just through the whole storm
         , and we just marched and sang for that whole storm just round and round and round that little table, um, underneath the shelter.
         He said it was the only thing he could think of to keep everybody from crying and screaming and not just absolutely petrified of this storm, um, and I remember one other time when I was little, um, my dad, as I said earlier, my dad traveled a lot with his job, and, um, there were also times when he had to travel out of the country.
         And, um, when I was very young, um, you know, he would be gone maybe, you know, a month or two and then be home two or three months and then be gone again, you know, and so each time, you know, he came home there was a period of a few days or even a week or so that was a real adjustment period for me, you know, because he'd been gone and then coming back.
         And so, I sort of had to, you know, build my trust with him again, you know, each time.
         And we had gone to, um, a store.
         I don't know if it was like K-mart or something like that, you know, a big old, you know, store and I was with him it was just the two of us because my mom had insisted that I go with him, you know, to just have sort of some father daughter time, I guess.
         And, um, we had gone and he had he was looking at something and he told me he said, "Now stay right here," and, of course, you know, I'm only like three
         or something.
         And, um, so, of course, a three-year-old is not going to stay right anywhere and I just kind of, you know, wandered down the aisle looking at something else or I may have turned the corner, I don't remember.
         And, of course, you know, after whatever it was lost interest for me I looked up.
         Well, you know, my dad wasn't in sight, and, of course, you know panic hit, you know, a three-year old and you know I start crying.
         Well a stock person or a worker or somebody found me and took me up to the, um, to the desk, and, uh, they were asking what my dad's name was or what he looked like and I remember saying, "He's just a bald-headed man named Ray."
         
         And so they, over the intercom they had to just say, "Would the bald headed man named Ray who owns a little red- headed girl please come to the service desk?"
         And so he had to come get me and was just absolutely mortified.
         Here, you know, he had just gotten back in from, you know, out of the country and, you know, takes his daughter somewhere, and then loses her, and I mean I wouldn't get near him.
         I wouldn't hold his hand, I wouldn't speak to him.
         And I remember getting home, and oh I mean I was just bursting in the door just crying wanting my mama.
         Well she happened to be in the bathroom at the time taking a bath and I remember just bursting into the bathroom just sobbing and just "Mama, Daddy lost me."
      
      
         
            Good morning everyone.
      
      
         So anyway I remember bursting in on my mom and just you know sobbing and sobbing.
         And, uh, I mean it was like weeks
         before I would go anywhere with my dad again ever.
         I mean I was just convinced he was going to lose me and every time he would ask me to go somewhere I would be like, "No you're going to lose me again," and, you know, it was just the longest time before I ever trusted him enough to even go anywhere with him.
         Um, and, I think that's most of like the little funny stories that I can remember.
         And, um, I hope they amused you.
      
   

   
   
      
         Testing, one, two, three, four.
         I'm here with Sean Jamieson he's going to be the third subject and I'm just making sure this recorder's working good.
         OK we're here with Sean Jamieson he is the third subject here in the, um, project and Sean is from Chicago originally.
         And, uh, how would you describe your, your accent, the way you speak or--
      
      
         To, to well I guess I, I of course I don't think I have an accent.
         Ah, I speak like ah everybody I grew up speaks, so, speaks the same way but, ah, to the extent I have one it's a, would be Midwestern I, I think more generically Midwestern than specifically Chicago.
         Chicago, to me, sound is, is more nasal and more pronounced and sounds like ah sounds surprisingly close to Chi, New York.
         Uh.
         But I don't think I speak like that however you may prove me wrong.
      
      
         But you're from the //suburban area.
         //
      
      
         // Suburban Chicago, // that's right.
      
      
         So that may have something to do with that.
      
      
         Um-hum.
      
      
         And, and how about living in the South?
         Do you think that's actually, ah, I mean when, if when, you go back up North do people say, "Hey I can tell you're picking up some `y'alls' or something."
      
      
         I have not heard that to the to the best of my knowledge I have never knowingly used the term "y'all."
      
      
         
         But, ah, maybe, maybe the words are slightly as far as you know.
      
      
         They might be I don't know, ah, you know, the people I hang out with in Charlotte by and large are, are not Southerners because the people I work with and the people who are my friends tend to be transplants as well.
         The newspaper business recruits nationally and so the people I work with are from all over the country.
      
      
         That's right.
      
      
         And only a minority, I guess, are Southerners and uh my friends here are, tend to be people from other places as well and rather than, rather than, ah, Southerners or Charlotteans, so I don't, ah, I'm not although when I'm in the store and when I'm out and about in other places yeah I hear the Southern accent but I don't I think my speech patterns are probably pretty much set at this point and, and I don't think I'm picking anything up.
      
      
         OK, so and we're talking, we're talking about, um, I guess going back to Chicago and um your, you want to talk about your family //um on your dad's side.
         //
      
      
         // Yeah I was.
         // Trying, trying to think of a subject to talk about and I I'm, I'm not good at remembering stories.
         I don't remember jokes and I don't remember stories which is, which says something about the way my brain works but I do remember you know hearing about family history and such and, and uh had asked about it since then to, to figure out how everybody, ah, came to be in Canada which is where is where my dad's side of the family is from and my dad came down to the United States in the middle of the 60s when he was working for a company in Guelph, Ontario, which is outside of Toronto and met my mom in at that time and he settled down they settled down in the Chicago suburbs and, and spent their whole lives there.
         Ah, but my dad both my grandparents on my dad's side were born in Europe.
         My grandfather was born in Edinburgh, Scotland, and my grandmother was born in County Cork, Ireland.
         They both immigrated well my grandmother immigrated to New York I believe and then made her way up to Rhode Island where I believe she worked as a domestic.
         And my grandfather ran away from home as a very young boy and became a sailor and sailed back and fourth across the Atlantic.
         I know that much and I don't know where all else he sailed but, ah, eventually got tired of that and left his ship in New York and, and was spending, was in New York and this was I guess about the time of WWI.
      
      
         Do you think he was fishing or was he doing.
      
      
         He was working he was doing some sort of work.
         I don't know exactly what, this is, this is a little bit, ah, hazy.
         I don't know if my dad's, if I've ever, if my dad's told me that I don't recall exactly what it was and then, my, so my, my grandfather was living in New York I believe in an immigrant community in New York and the Canadian Army was recruiting from among immigrants because I believe at the time the Canadians did not, uh, did not draft, did not draft during WWI, and try need, but they needed to help the British fighting in Europe and so the they decided that a good place to recruit would be among the immigrant communities in NY, particularly among people who had immigrated from the British Isles.
         And the promise was that if you made it through the war you would have a shot at some, ah, you know, there would be money for you at the end, ah, you'd be able to settle in Canada.
         And so my grandfather joined the Brit, and joined the Canadian army, fought in France, was wounded, and eventually made his way back to, I guess, New York and then up to Rhode Island where he met my grandmother.
         I don't know the exact sequence of events here but he met my grandmother and then moved to, to, ah, Ontario Canada where- -
      
      
         He had a farm waiting for him right?
      
      
         Where he had a, where he became, tried to become, a farmer and this was an area about 60 miles southwest of Toronto in what at the time must have been a pretty remote part of part of the province.
         Turns out he was not very successful as a farmer and gave that up and moved into the city of Guelph which was a decent sized a free standing city outside of, of Toronto but much smaller than Toronto and build a house there and became, did a variety of jobs ah I don't believe I don't know if he had a particular trade other than being a sailor so he worked in a variety of jobs.
         I know during the Depression he worked as a, as a night watchman at a factory and he was my dad talked about how he, how my grandfather felt very fortunate that he didn't lose his job during the Depression, that at least he was able to keep a job all through the Depression working as a night watchman, and they built a house which the family owns as of today.
         In fact my aunt who just died within the last month was living in the house that my grandmother and grandfather built when they first moved to Guelph very old wood-framed house on two lots and at the time this wasn't a big deal but now it is, there's about a hundred yards of, a hundred yard wide strip of forest behind the house and then behind that is a private country club, and a very nice one and so the land the land has become very valuable.
         At the time obviously it wasn't a big deal to live on a golf course and now it is, so that, that property is still in the family, um, as a kid my I used to go, we used to go up there every year for family reunions we would ah drive from Chicago through Detroit up to Guelph.
      
      
         To the same house?
      
      
         To the same house that my grandmother and grandfather had had built and, uh, attend the family reunion my dad was one of eight kids and I guess six of them married and everybody had at least three kids.
         The number of kids that my aunts and uncles had varied I guess from three to six.
         So there was a pretty good, good crowd at the reunions.
      
      
         
            .
      
      
         Typically about 75 to 80 people at each at each reunion which is held in August of every year.
      
      
         You ever count how many first cousins you have.
         
      
      
         Um, I'm not sure I know.
         Somebody has these numbers but I'm not sure, but, ah, but my dad's, my dad's siblings were so, ah, spread out in age they're at least 20 years at least 20 years from the oldest to the youngest so my oldest uncle had married fairly young he had fought in WWII and he was married during WWII and I believe he and my aunt had their first child during the War, and that, that was a cousin of mine named Dave, who I, oh, when I first met him and his wife I thought they were my aunt and uncle but when I got older I realized that they're actually my first cousins they were just old enough to be my parents and so it seemed to me like they were too old to be cousins because the people I associated with being my cousins were my age or relatively close to my age, uh, and they were a large group of these kids but these other two were like, um, my parents' age and hanging out with my parents at the reunion and you know drinking beer under the tent and shooting the crap, and I just thought they were my
         aunt and uncle, but they were actually my cousins, uh, and that was because--
      
      
         It's like their, ah, dad's, ah, brother or sister beared children other--
      
      
         Yeah, exactly, exactly.
      
      
         Your dad's probably, ah, oldest brother.
      
      
         Right that was my dad's oldest brother and his wife's oldest kids so there was, and then, then there would be different people who would show up at different reunions so every year there would be people there who I didn't know and then I would, we're fairly close relatives but I didn't know who they were and so I would always have to be asking or would kind of wait for an introduction of some sort.
         So it was quite, you needed a scorecard to keep track of who was who.
         And it got even more confusing when my cousins got older and would bring girlfriends or boyfriends or spouses who I never met before to, oh, the reunions and it all just, ah, so, it's still, uh, these days, I was at one about two years ago a reunion and there are still about 75 to 80 people who show up consistently every year although it's, it's a different group of people they'll be, you know, there's a group of maybe 20 or 25 who don't come to every reunion like me but there'll be a different 20 or 25 in there.
         So the number of people who show up is pretty consistent it's just that the group changes somewhat from year to year as the people are, are available to make the weekend or aren't.
         Um--
      
      
         Is it every year they have the reunion?
      
      
         Every year, yeah we do a reunion every year.
         And it was, was my, my aunt who owned my Aunt Pat who had the, ah, my grandparents' old house, who was instrumental in getting these started and keeping them going because she realized she told me this just within the last couple of years that she thought it was very important to have the reunions every year so the family would stay in touch with each other cause otherwise I would never have known my cousins because the only things we might have gotten together for would be maybe at weddings and funerals which are not good opportunities to do much mixing and mingling because there are other things on the agenda.
         At a wedding or a funeral it's really hard to catch up with people.
         So my aunt had been, had been real smart about, about scheduling those every year and trying to get as many people there as possible so that we all, ah, kept in touch and we all know who our cousins and our relatives were.
      
      
         So who's going to, ah, start doing that, who's going to be coordinating that now that she's?
      
      
         Ah, one of my cousins apparently is, well, two of my cousins are, are keeping it going in fact.
         I just had a phone message tonight from my dad saying that the date has been set for this August on the reunion and, ah, it's not clear who's going to host it but, ah, there's still quite a large group of family members in this city of Guelph and somebody is going to end up hosting it.
         Ah, the reason that, one of the reasons my Aunt Pat was always good at being the hostess for it is that the family had, there are two small houses on four big lots on this dead-end street, so there was a lot of room for everybody to kind of spread out, put up a couple of tents or shelters or whatever, have barbecue grills out there, and, uh, a couple of houses to run in and use the bathroom, whatever, so there's just a lot of room and, uh, but it's not clear if that house is going to be sold or not now that my aunt has, ah, passed away.
         Apparently in her will she said that the house should be sold and the money given to a, ah, couple of my aunts and it's not clear if a family member is going to buy the house and sort of keep it in the family or what's going happen to it, but I'm hoping that they keep it because it's, it's, ah, there's so many family members there that you think somebody would want to hang on to it and it's such a nice set up with really sort of an extended family that always sort of lived right on this block and uh I'm thinking would probably want to keep, hang on to the house.
      
      
         How many of your, um, um I guess that's these are all the, ah, brothers and sisters of your, your dad?
      
      
         Of my dad yeah.
      
      
         How many of them live in is it Guelph?
      
      
         It's the name of the city is Guelph.
         Yeah it's named for a city in Belgium I believe and I'm not sure.
      
      
         How do you spell it?
      
      
         G-U-E-L-P-H.
      
      
         OK.
      
      
         And I'm not sure why it's named for a city in Belgium but it is.
         There is let's see I've got an aunt and an uncle and two of their kids are still there.
         I've got an aunt who's a widow and a cousin.
         I, I'm running out of fingers here but, ah, and then an aunt or ah, a, a cousin and his wife and their three kids, and, let's see, that's about a dozen people right there that I can think of off the top of my head and then quite a few cousins and their and their families and kids are in the Toronto area some of, some of them have moved away and come back, ah, but everybody, most of them have sort of settled in and around the Toronto area in the suburbs in one direction or another.
         Oh there's, in fact, there's a cousin and her husband and their, ah, their six kids who just moved back to Guelph after having been ah, ah his business had taken him away for a couple of years but now they're back in Guelph so that's number six.
         So I'd say there must be at least 20 uh, immediate relatives that are still living in Guelph.
      
      
         Um now how big of a city is that?
      
      
         I want to say it's 90 or 100 thousand or something like that.
         There's a couple of other cities of similar size nearby so it's almost getting to be like its own metropolitan area, small metro area.
      
      
         Right.
         So it's, um, almost like you'll, you'll meet, ah, if you go to Guelph you'll meet someone will probably know a Jamieson there.
      
      
         Yeah, yeah because some of, like my aunt who just died was a bookkeeper who worked at a lot of local businesses and was extremely gregarious, so I think she was probably on a first name basis with a awful lot of the people who shopped downtown or whoever went downtown she was she lived there all her life and just knew a lot of people and they sort of come out of that kind of, that Irish tradition like everybody's your friend, everybody's your neighbor and even people that, ah should be fairly casually, she'd greet those people by name and know a little bit about them, ah, and so yeah she's, ah, and my cousin, one of my cousins, has a couple of businesses in town and I think is relatively well-known is on some sort of city board, or something like that.
         Yeah the family is big enough and the city is small enough I think that you would run into a decent number of people who would know a Jamieson or two.
      
      
         Or at least somebo dy married to a Jamieson.
      
      
         That's right.
         
      
      
         Interesting.
      
      
         Uh-huh.
      
      
         And then, ah, I guess the family reunion is, when is the next one you're going to go to?
      
      
         It's August 12th of this year, August 12th of 2000, and, uh, don't know, don't know too many more details about it and don't know if I'll be able to go.
         I went a couple of years ago and didn't make it last year and I'm, I'm, now I'm kind of sorry I didn't, because my aunt passed away in the meantime, and I knew she was in poor health last year.
         Oh but there's just, um, just a couple of my dad's generation left.
         It's, they're starting to get up there and, and a lifetime of bad eating habits is starting to catch up, although my aunt was about 75 when she when she died so she had a, she had a long run.
      
      
         Sounds like she was getting out and meeting a lot of people.
      
      
         She was, yeah right up, right up to the day, ah, when she fell, and I think she fell and broke her hip, if I recall what put her in the hospital.
         She was, ah, I think she was, ah, downtown, I think she had taken the bus or a cab downtown, and had, uh, met with her lady friends to have lunch or something.
         She did almost every day and I recall that she slipped and fell, and then, as happens with a lot of older people, developed complications while she was in the hospital and, ah, never, never recovered unfortunately.
         It sounds simple breaking your hip but you just, it is, I, I'm sure, you know, older people who've had that happen to them, you get into the hospital and you end up catching an infection or something like that from somebody else and your immune system is kind of weakened and she just, um, um, didn't make it unfortunately.
      
      
         It sounds like a big loss for the community just because there was so many people and she organized the family reunions but you know at least you know you've got somebody that's going to take over and start putting that back together there.
      
      
         Yeah but Aunt Pat was definitely the matriarch of the family.
      
      
         Matriarch, huh?
      
      
         Matriarch.
         That's a good, that's a good vocabulary word.
         You can, you can probably add a whole chapter in the report of my use of the word matriarch.
         
      
      
         That and a couple of others too.
         I'm sure.
         OK.
         I'm not sure if I said, ah, Sean's name, but this is Sean Jamieson from Charlotte, and, um, and, uh, you know, he's the third, um, subject.
      
      
         I think you did say that.
         You might have said my name at the beginning.
         I'm just not positive.
         Is it?
      
      
         And, uh, I think we did a little background on your dialect, or how you think you speak.
      
      
         That's right, that's right.
      
      
         OK that's, that's, and that should wrap it up there.
         Thanks Sean.
      
   

   
   
      
         Last summer, over the Fourth of July, our family decided to take a vacation
         .
         We decided to go to Myrtle Beach, SC.
         We left early on a Thursday morning around 10:00.
         It was about a five-hour drive.
         It seemed like a ten-hour drive with three children in the car wanting something to drink.
         They were fighting.
         They were cooped; they didn't like being cooped up in their seat belts, so we had to stop quite often.
         We finally got to Myrtle Beach in the afternoon.
         We checked into a motel room at the south end of Myrtle.
         We were right on the beach.
         It was great.
         After we checked into the motel room
         we decided to take a walk on the beach.
         It was a beautiful afternoon, about 80 degrees.
         We walked for about thirty minutes and then came back and sat on the beach
         .
         After we sat on the beach, we decided that we should get ready to go out to dinner
         .
         After we got ready to go about to dinner, we drove around looking for a restaurant.
         We finally found an all you can eat seafood buffet.
         They had crab legs, crab cakes, shrimp, oysters, clams.
         It was great.
         We ate until we were all stuffed
         .
         After we ate dinner we decided to go and play some games in the arcade.
         The kids went bowling, shot basketball, and just ran around crazy.
         It was getting late, but we decided that we should go on the bumper cars.
         The bumper cars were a blast.
         We kept stalling and bumping and going around in circles, and we just had a wonderful time on the bumper cars
         .
         By then we decided we should go back to the room.
         It wasn't that late, it was only about nine o'clock, so we decided to get some flashlights and go for a walk on the beach.
         We went out on the beach and started to hunt for little sand crabs.
         They are so much fun to try and catch.
         You blind then with the flashlight and then you catch them from behind.
         But watch out because it's, they like to pinch.
         We got about ten sand crabs in a bucket and then decided to let them all go.
         They all went crazy.
         The beach was beautiful, the stars were out.
         It was calm.
         It was a great night just to sit and relax
         .
         The next day we got up around nine o'clock and decided to go sit out and play on the beach.
         The kids built sandcastles, and played in the waves and laid out in the sun.
         My two boys decided to bury each other.
         They dug a humongous hole, my husband helped them.
         We put one boy in one hole and the other one in the other hole, and we covered them all the way up to their shoulders and their heads were just sticking out.
         They thought it was a blast.
         We decided to just leave them there for a while because they couldn't get into any trouble
         .
         They finally got themselves out of their deep holes and they went in the ocean and took some rafts and tried to ride the waves.
         By then it was time for lunch.
         We decided just to go down to a hotdog stand and get some hotdogs to eat.
         And to chill off in the shade since to was getting kind of hot.
         So we sat around and ate hotdogs and milkshakes and then went back out in the sand for a while longer, I took a nap, and my husband and the boys played Frisbee.
         
         It was the Fourth of July; so we decided that we should get off the beach for a while and let the kids take a rest.
         After their rest we decided to eat dinner out on, on the beach at a little restaurant, they had a nice little band.
         The firecrackers were already being set off.
         Children were running around with sparklers.
         It was getting wild and it wasn't even dark yet.
         We sat around and listened to music and then decided it was time for us to let some of our own firecrackers off.
         We had a blast.
         The kids had a blast.
         Everybody was going crazy.
         It was a fun Fourth of July.
         I was afraid I was going to step on a hot firecracker because they were all over the place.
         People weren't even looking where they were shooting them off.
         It was just, "Bang!
         Bang!
         Bang!"
         But they were really pretty and it was a wonderful evening
         .
         We took a walk on the beach and so we could see some more fireworks.
         They were everywhere.
         We went down to a dock and someone was letting them off on a dock.
         They were all so pretty, it was so much fun.
         Well, it was getting late so I think it is time to go home.
         So, we went back to the room and we all fell asleep.
         We were going to have to leave the next day, so the next day we decided to play on the beach until late in the afternoon
         and late in the afternoon we decided that we had better get on the road.
         The kids were exhausted.
         They slept in the car all the way back and that is the story about our long weekend vacation during the Fourth of July.
      
   

   
   
      
         How are you doing today?
      
      
         I'm doing fine.
      
      
         You ready to tell a story?
      
      
         Yes.
      
      
         OK.
      
      
         I'm trying to think of a story I should tell.
         
         OK.
         Well, I worked as a police officer for the town of Matthews for about four and a half years until recently.
         And I'll tell the story of one of my chases and if that doesn't go enough time I'll tell the story of another chase, vehicle chase.
         Um,
         one night after I had arrested my second DWI, I took the DWI down to the intake center, that's the jail in downtown, took him down to the jail and him processed and got him in.
         And on my way back home, I take Independence Blvd on the way back into Matthews.
         And about at probably Idlewild Rd, no, probably at Albemarle Rd, I got in behind, uh, this is still in Charlotte so it wasn't in my jurisdiction, I got in behind a ,uh, an old, like '69 or '70 Oldsmobile Cutlass that had a paper tag.
         And I didn't think anything about it.
         
         I did, I did notice it and that it had a paper tag and that it was primer, primer black, black primer.
      
      
         Paper tag?
      
      
         Paper tag, a 30-day tag.
      
      
         OK.
      
      
         And which you can track them, but it's real hard to because it's so, it's common to switch them.
         And I, we, we were headed outbound on highway, on Independence Blvd, Highway 74 and I noticed he was running about 50 miles an hour, 50, 55.
         So I got in behind him, or not behind him, but I was in the lane beside of him and he was little bit ahead of me for the turn, for the vehicle was a little ahead of me.
         And I didn't think anything about it.
         Well, uh, I noticed he, he sped up to 60 miles an hour.
         And so I sped up to 60 just to see what he was doing, just to kind of let him know, "Hey you're speeding!"
         you know.
         And, and we, we're still headed outbound, we cross over, um, we cross over Idlewild and, um, no actually, no this is right prior to Idlewild and he's running 60 miles an hour.
         And then he goes, he starts going 65 as we, as we cross over Conference.
         And so I'm going 65.
         And, um, I got on the radio with Charlotte thinking he might be impaired or you know, drunk or something like that.
         So I try to get in, get on the, the radio with Charlotte.
         And as I'm going down the road 65 miles an hour I see the Charlotte police officer on the right hand side sitting in front of, uh, um, that shopping area right, right prior to Conference.
      
      
         Is that where the Harris-Teeter's at?
      
      
         Yeah.
         He's, he's sitting right back up there.
         And I try to tell Charlotte that we just passed an officer and needless, to say, uh, they didn't get up with him.
         And so I called my, my sergeant and let him know that I was coming inbound.
         By this time we were running 70 miles an hour.
         We're passing, um, the roads were wet, it had been raining that night.
         And, um, we pass, um, we pass, uh, uh, the car dealerships on our left hand side.
         We're running 70 as we come past probably the, probably at Harris Blvd.
         And so I went ahead and let my units know up ahead as soon as we got into Matthews, he's getting blue lighted.
         And I felt that he was impaired to go ahead and start another unit then.
         And so we're running 70, probably 70, a good 70 miles an hour and we go, we pass over Sardis North and right as we get into Matthews about where, uh, Crown Point Executive Dr is, I, uh, told them I was initiating a stop.
         So I flipped on my blue lights and it was on!
         He took off and was running about 90 miles an hour and I'm right in behind him, um, I'm keeping radio contact with, um, with dispatch and the other units.
         And, um, Rich, Brian Rich, evidently came up, uh, Sam Newell and got in behind me.
         I didn't see him because I was worried about this guy.
         We're running, we're heading past, we're probably at, at the Pep Boys now, maybe where the Boston Market is.
         We're running probably a hundred.
         Um, we got up to, the fastest we got up to on 74 was about 110.
         And, um, he's still getting on along and, uh, I'm still sticking with him and I felt uncomfortable on the wet roads.
         And, um, my sergeant, of course, was asking me during the chase, that's, uh, Sergeant Stevens, was making sure that the traffic was, was OK and that I felt OK with the chase.
         And the, the, the, what the driver was doing, you know, keeping up with all the locations and landmarks which I, I do pretty well; I was ready with that.
         And dispatch is, you know, telling me whenever I'd call out I'd say, "OK.
         Independence and Winter Square Dr." And they'd say, "10-four Independence and Winter Square Dr." And I said, "Still continuing eastbound on Highway 74."
         And, um, so we're running, we're booking on along about 110 or so and I say, uh, "Headquarters, the roads are wet.
         I don't feel comfortable anymore.
         I'm going to go ahead and 22 the chase."
         10-22 is `Disregard the Chase,' you know, go ahead and, and let back.
         I had already called 10-43, which is `Pursuit.
         ' The minute you call 10- 43, basically all radio traffic ceases and you are the, you're the main person.
         Rich evidently had gotten in behind me and I 22'ed the chase probably about the Highway 51 bridge maybe a little past it.
         And so as I'm backing off, I'm, I'm still keeping an eye on him if he's slowing down a little bit and he goes to highway, to Matthews-Mint Hill and 74 makes a left hand turn.
         And so I went ahead and, uh, got back in the chase again because I figured, um, you know, I just figured I'd go ahead, go ahead and chase him because I knew that he couldn't keep up that kind of speed on the, uh, on the Matthews-Mint Hill.
         And Rich was in behind me by then and so we head on the way down Matthews-Mint Hill, we probably running around 80 or 90 miles an hour.
         We get to, uh, Providence or, uh, I'm sorry, we get to Highway 51 to Matthews-Mint Hill and he makes that right turn and he slows down for that and so I'm right in behind him, blue lights and sirens all the way.
         Give them my location and Brian Rich is behind me.
         And, uh, we're heading out on Idlewild Rd, we're, or we're on 51, Matthews-Mint Hill, both being the same now.
         We get to the Petro, we get to the Petro, now the BP station at Idlewild and 51, he makes a right heading towards Union County.
         And, uh, so we start heading down that way and, uh, we're going on down Idlewild Rd, keep right on going, cross over 485 construction, which it was under construction at that point, and, um, we're, we're running a good clip.
         And, uh, by that time, what I had done, was, you know, at about 51 or so I had switched over, I was talking to Charlotte- Mecklenburg and the Highway Patrol on my main car radio and talking to Matthews dispatch on my hand held, as, as I'm driving.
         Um, Rich, Brian Rich is still behind me and as we didn't have our new radio tower up, had we had the radio tower up, I would be able to maintain contact with Matthews on my hand-held, but the hand-helds don't transmit very well.
         Um, so, I mean, I was still maintaining contact and they could still hear me on, uh, Mutual Aid, but the thing was I should have been on Matthews, uh, main channel on my car radio because it transmits stronger.
         Uh,
         Brian's still behind me and, um, so I'm getting on with the Highway Patrol, trying to have the Highway Patrol come and, and meet with me because we're heading towards Union County.
         Not that I can't chase into Union county, but I'd much rather have the Highway Patrolman out there myself, because they'll ram somebody off the road in a heart beat!
      
      
         
      
      
         Not really, but, uh, they're better at chases; they've had training in chases.
         And, um, so we start going over some hills down Idlewild Rd and Brian Rich loses me.
         Um, or I should say, both of us lost him.
         I'm still maintaining contact with, with Highway Patrol and, uh, they're hearing me fine and, uh, they're trying to get somebody out there to me.
         But as we down to, we're heading, we're getting into Union County a good ways and we get down to, we cross over Stevens Mill, and there's the next road pass Steven's Mill, I think it's Union Mill or Indian Trail Rd, I'm not exactly sure.
         And there's a BP station right there.
         They lost me and I'm still transmitting on Mutual Aid because I didn't see any units around me and I knew we were headed towards a Highway Patrol station, because they're down there on Seacrest Short Cut and pretty soon Unionville Rd or Idlewild I think turns into Seacrest Short Cut, I believe.
         And, uh, so my sergeant gets on the radio and says, uh, you know, "321 if you can copy me.
         22 your chase!
         22 your chase!"
         And so I disregarded my chase and parked at the BP station and, uh, advised Highway Patrol that I was being 22'ed by my sergeant.
         And, uh, so I parked there and kind of calmed down for a few minutes and here comes Rich and here comes Sergeant Stevens.
         And so he, both pulls in, they both pull in, you know, and I let them know that I lost him and then a Highway Patrolman comes up and, uh, asks, "Which way did he go?"
         and I say, "He went down that way."
         And so he heads out that way spinning tires trying, trying to catch up to the guy.
         My best guess is what he did was, when I 22'ed, he probably took a side road and uh, headed, headed out into the county somewhere.
      
      
         So he was never caught?
      
      
         No.
         Never caught.
         My, I probably, he was either, it probably wasn't a stolen car or anything like that.
         Probably what had happened was his license was revoked, or he was DWI, or something like that, and, uh, but, but the whole thing about it was, had I maintained contact with Matthews on my main radio, we would have probably caught him or at least been able to get the Highway Patrol up there and they could have assumed the chase.
         And of course, I would have to have been the secondary unit because I, I started the chase.
         So-
      
      
         Did you get into trouble?
      
      
         No Harris just told me, "Next time be on your radio."
         And Glenn, one of the dispatchers up there, he goes "We didn't have to do anything.
         Uh, you were contacting Highway Patrol and you were contacting us and basically you were doing our job for us."
         But I knew that was wrong thing to do.
         But at the time I didn't know where any of my other units were.
         I knew Rich was behind me but I had lost sight of him.
         Pat said he was just afraid that I had, uh, that I had wrecked or something like that.
         That I was, you know, in the woods somewhere up against a tree in my patrol car after running 90 miles an hour down Idlewild Rd as it gets curvy.
         But that was the story of my one chase.
      
      
         Thank you.
      
      
         You're very welcome.
      
   

   
   
      
         When I was three years old my family and I moved to Myrtle Beach, SC from Woonsocket, RI, and when I was younger, I guess about seven, eight, nine years old, every Christmas my family and I would go to visit our relatives in Woonsocket, and we usually left on the 22nd of December, and I remember it being a really long car ride 16 hours and my sister, my younger sister, who was four years younger than me, would often fight in the back seat, and when we got there, um, we would stay in a hotel called the Suisse Chalet, and it was in Smits, Smithfield, RI, which was about 20 minutes away from Woonsocket where my relatives were from, and in Woonsocket we would visit both my sets of grandparents, who lived there, and it's tradition in my family that on Christmas Eve we would eat dinner at, um, my grandparents house on my mom's side and my grandmother would cook a huge dinner Christmas dinner and Christmas Eve dinner, and we would open one of our Christmas presents, which I thought was a great
         tradition, and it's a tradition that we still practice to this day, and usually on New Year's Day my mother's family had a tradition of renting a hall or a restaurant bar that was sort of a reunion, um, so that we could see all of our relatives, and I remember spending time with my cousins who, Stacy and Stephanie, who were about my age.
         Um, at the time, when I was a sophomore in college at Notre Dame I decided to go on Spring Break, which happened around late March, and I decided to go to Boca Raton, FL with my best friend from high school.
         Her name was Crystal.
         And so, um, we met in FL, and in Boca Raton and we stayed with my grandparents, and we would stay with my grandparents for at least one night, uh Boca Raton, and then the rest of the week we spent in Fort Lauderdale because my grandfather owned a hotel called The Sanddollar in a place called Lauderdale by the Sea, um, in Fort Lauderdale, and it was fantastic time and when we had the chance to spend time together and just go out on the beach and at night we would go out to dinner I remember going to a Benihana Japanese steakhouse, and we just felt like we had freedom, and then we weren't yet 21 so we weren't allowed to go to clubs in Fort Lauderdale, so we basically spent our time, uh, watching movies in the hotel room or just walking along the strip and I remember going out for ice cream one night and just walking along the boardwalk it was very, very peaceful time, and the worst part of the vacation was getting sunburned, um, because I'm extremely pale, and going out on the beach
         everyday for hours on end turned me into a lobster, and, um, my friend Crystal would always joke with me and call me, um, her lobster.
         One of my best friends growing up, um, was named Bonnie Martin, and I met her when I was in fourth grade at St. Andrew's Catholic School and we became friends, um, almost immediately because we learned that we lived close to one another and it was about maybe the second or third week of school when she invited me to her house, and she lived, um, in an oceanfront house, and, uh, we went, um, we spent the day watching TV, watching General Hospital, which was both of are favorite shows, and we would walk on the beach, and we would play with her dog and then we would walk down to the pond and feed the ducks and we would ride our bicycles all around the neighborhood.
         And I remember, in particular, one day my grandmother had called our house.
         It was an afternoon in January, and there was no school that day, and my mom told me that my grandfather, who lived in RI, had died, and I guess at the time I wasn't able to deal with my emotions or that I was in denial that it happened and I remember just running away to my best friend Bonnie's house and not even telling my mom or my dad where I was going, and I got to her house and I told my friend what had happened and she could tell that I was really upset about it, and so I just felt I'd just run away.
         We went on our bicycles and we told pretty much the whole way, and I guess that her mom Dottie had called my mom and told her that I was OK because I'm sure that she was worried.
         You know, I all of a sudden ran out of the house with no explanation, but it was very comforting to spend that time with my friend, and I didn't want to be alone and it was a really good experience.
         My friend Maria Cartsokalis, um, who I went to school with at St. Andrew's, and we became friends when I was in fifth or sixth grade and she lived across the street from me and I loved to go to her house because she had a pool and my parents did not.
         And so I would go over there and we would watch TV on Saturday mornings, and usually I would spend the night, and, um, so we'd watch TV during the day and then we would go shopping at the mall and her mom always gave us 20 dollars to spend on anything we wanted so that was always fun and I remember we would during the day watch music videos and just hang out and have fun, and she had an older sister named Tina, and it was in high school, and we were in grade school at the time, and we would always try on her clothes and because she was really stylish and had the Guess?
         jeans and the jean jackets, and the cute, you know, skirts and tops and I don't know what happened to our friendship, Maria and mine.
         A few years later, when I was in eighth grade, we got into a fight at school involving another girl in our class, and I don't even remember what the fight was over, and it seemed like a silly reason at the time.
         And what's amazing is that we didn't talk for at least three or four years, um, because of that fight, and it was sad for me because she lived across the street, and I felt like I couldn't talk to her anymore, and it was only our senior year in high school that, um, we finally were able to patch things up.
         She, her locker was next to mine and I remember one day we just said, "Hi," to each other for the first time after ignoring each other for the entire year, and, um, it was liberating, it was great that we could finally talk and make up, and since then, um, you know, we've kept in touch when we were both in college, and I ran into her here in Charlotte about a couple of weeks ago.
         It seems that we go to the same church St. Gabriel's Catholic Church here in Charlotte and it was neat to see her here because I didn't realize she had moved to Charlotte.
         I thought she was still living in Myrtle Beach where her parents lived so.
      
   

   
   
      
         Resident with me and the most from my childhood was, ah, the story about my grandmother.
         My mother I'm, I'm from Charlotte, and my mother was from here as, well she died in 1992, yeah December 1992, and she the only girl of 10 kids.
         She had nine brothers.
         I had nine uncles.
         Three of them are still living.
         Uh, but one of the stories, uh, my grandmother was born in 1898, yeah, 1898, and she lived to be, ah, 102.
         So she had 10 kids, and, of course, her parents had been slaves.
      
      
         Uh-huh.
      
      
         So, um, my mother grew up out near the airport, near, in the Steele Creek community and, um, my grandmother, for all those years, all the 20th century, basically, lived out in the country until the last three years of her life.
         She came and lived with us.
         But she had her leg amputated so she moved in with us and we took care of her.
         Uh, but before that she was in the country, and so my mom use to talk about how as the only girl she would have to wash dishes and do the domestic things, so even at dinner, Sunday dinner, if their were a chicken, if they had fried chicken, my mother had to wait for her brothers to eat the choice pieces of chicken and then she could eat a wing or a back or a neck and to the day she died that's how she was.
         If she fried some chicken for us she'd always eat the smallest pieces.
         The meager looking pieces.
         So my mother use to sit back in her chair in the den and talk about how one Saturday Granny, uh, had decided she was going to go to town and you know back then, you're talking, oh probably 1930s, early 1930s, uh, my mother would've been 10 or 12, somewhere around there, and Granny, uh, went to the train track to get on the little trolley train, whatever they had at that time to come downtown.
      
      
         Uh-huh.
      
      
         Well during her absence my mom was suppose to clean the house and probably prepared dinner and stuff like that.
         This was a Saturday.
         Well my mom thinking, "Oh Mom's gone all day."
         She's gone hang out a little bit.
         Well after about, I don't know, about two hours, two and a half hours, I think, my mom said Granny came back and she was quite upset.
         One, Mama hadn't done any work she was suppose to do, and she got a beat down, all right, and two, Granny had sat about two hours at the, um, train stop and she hadn't noticed the tracks had been moved.
      
      
         Uh-huh.
      
      
         So there was no longer a train that ran there and so,
         I don't know what the, um, I don't know what the rationale was for all of that.
         I guess they just changed the route and what not, but, uh, she laughed about that all the time, my mom did, she didn't laugh at the time she was getting beat, ah, but she use to always tell us that was really the only time that she got beat //
      
      
         Uh-huh.
      
      
         //by Granny and, and she never beat her boys because her boys could did no wrong in her mind.
         So that's probably my favorite story about, uh, or from my mom that I recall.
         I believe, yeah.
         And then, hum, there's another story, well this is a, this is not a, this is not a story she passed down this is a story of mine, I guess.
      
      
         Uh-huh.
      
      
         That happened with Mama and Granny and my sister Reda.
      
      
         OK.
      
      
         Now bear in mind that I told you Granny moved in with us, um, towards the later years of her life, and when she moved in with us I was in the 10th grade, so I was just starting high school.
         Um, you know, going through puberty and dating and playing basketball and stuff like that.
         That, that was my favorite sport.
         So my senior year, I went to the health department, to get a physical.
         That's required for those who are playing sports.
      
      
         Yeah.
      
      
         You got to have a physical.
         No problem.
         I was up on Beatties Ford Road.
         Everybody knows where the health department is there.
         Well, standard procedure back then, I don't know what it is now, is that you come in, someone comes in and they give you, now I don't if it's like this now, but back then they would give you a bag of prophylactics, condoms, all right.
         So they gave me a bag, and I didn't really, you know, pay any attention to it.
         So I said, "OK, fine," and I actually put them in my trunk, trunk of my car.
      
      
         Uh-huh.
      
      
         This was like a Monday or a Tuesday.
         Now my mother never drove, her entire life she never drove, so I took her wherever she went.
      
      
         Uh-huh.
      
      
         Took her to the grocery store, took her to church, stuff like that.
         My grandmother never drove either, even before she had her leg amputated.
         So Sunday comes around and this particular Sunday we're taking Granny to her home church.
      
      
         Uh-huh.
      
      
         Out in the Steele Creek area, out past the airport.
         And that's fine, you know, I'm driving.
         I got, ah, at that point I was driving an Oldsmobile Delta 88.
         It was a diesel.
         And so this Sunday morning we had eaten breakfast and we're getting Granny situated in her wheelchair and everything and that was pretty much my job, and I told my mom and my sister to go out to the car and open the trunk.
         And my sister Rita did that.
         All of a sudden we hear these yells.
      
      
         Uh-huh.
      
      
         "Oh my goodness something's happened, Mama!
         Come back here."
         I'm thinking they found a dead dog, or, you know, something in the driveway, backyard.
         Then Mama goes, uh, "Oh Lord, help me."
         
         I say, "What is the problem?"
         And so, "Jeff, Jeff get out here right now!"
         I mean everybody in the neighborhood.
         I mean it's Sunday morning and this is an old black neighborhood, everybody knows everybody.
         And so, I take Granny out, wheel her out, through the front door.
         I said, "Well, I say Granny, Mama's calling me.
         Something's wrong, but let's go on out and I'll get you situated in the car."
         And, um, get her in there and around to the back.
         "Explain this," and I said, "Explain what?
         I just told you to open the trunk."
         Well low and behold the condoms, which are multi-colored, had fallen out the bag.
         So they spread out all over the trunk, red, green, blue, whatever.
         And it's Sunday morning, we're on our way to church.
         I'm like, "Well," I'm speechless, what am I going to say, they already convicted me now, my mother and my sister.
         So, needless to say, that, that ride to church was very quiet and they said, "Excuse me, this afternoon you and your nephews," my sister's kids, who are my age, uh, "we're going to have a talk after dinner."
         And so we had the birds and the bees talk after dinner.
      
      
         Uh-huh.
      
      
         Now remember my mother was at that point, at that point, she was probably, she had me when she was 46, so she was close to 60, yeah she was close to 60 at that point.
         And it's hard enough talking to your parents about sex if they're fairly young.
         It's definitely hard getting it from a 60 year old.
      
      
         Uh-huh.
      
      
         Now, of course, my dad never talked to me about any of that stuff, but that's another story.
         So we had Sunday dinner and we went through the do's and don'ts of sexuality.
         Needless to say, my nephews and I were quite embarrassed and didn't want to be there.
         But they were just convinced that they were getting ready to just ruin our lives, but some women were going get us to do some stuff they didn't need to do and we were going be some baby's daddy, and Lord, and that's my story in terms of, um, um, something we still laugh about my sister and I, yeah.
      
      
         Thank you
      
      
         That will work.
      
   

   
   
      
         What's your name?
      
      
         Linda Solomon Lidington.
      
      
         And this for the Charlotte Narrative Project.
      
      
         Well, my grandmother, who's your great-grandmother, used to be able to tell me a lot of, you know, a lot a stories that happened in her family, and since I was a history major in college and I was studying and I was studying about formation of unions and so forth, particularly in the South, I thought this one was really interesting, but it's really two stories in one.
         And it was back during the 1930s, and, you know, the country was in a depression, and my grandmother and my mom lived with her, mm, lived with, lived with her mother and father.
         In other words, my mom's grandmother, which would be my great grandmother, your great great grandmother.
         And my
         great great grandfather, my great grandfather was the general manager of a woolen mill.
         I believe it was a woolen mill because, in SC, oh, in a lot of parts of the Carolinas there were a lot of different types of mills: cotton mills, woolen mills.
         Um, and he was over this woolen mill in Union, SC.
         And at that time there was a movement to unionize, and most of the mill owners and managers and so forth were against unions at that time.
         But my great grandfather was sort of open to it.
         He was a very, you know, nice person and very good mannered, supposedly.
         And, um, not only was he over that mill, but they, he also owned, or co- owned or rented or something, some small houses, some small, I guess, we would probably call them shanty type houses `cause they were very small.
         Ah, and they were used by some of the, you know, some, some of the black people and some of the white people in this little small town.
         And everybody knew everybody even the black families knew the white families.
         And, um
         anyway there was this big push to unionize and I guess my uncle, my grandfather was, great grandfather was trying to be open-minded about the whole thing, but apparently, there were some real problems, and one afternoon, one of the, uh, union organizers, who was from Union, who was actually a citizen because they had brought, because lots of times they brought in people from the North to help form these unions.
         And, uh, this guy was actually from Union, was actually a neighbor, but he had a history of mental problems.
         And, uh, this afternoon he, that afternoon he came over and got very, I guess he was very demanding and, uh, was, I guess he was also acting very strange.
         For whatever reason he shot and killed my great grandfather over a union issue in his front yard, in my grandfather's front yard, and my mother and grandmother and great grandmother all witnessed it.
         And the guy was never charged with murder or anything because he was so mentally unstable.
         So he was just, you know, trotted off to a mental institution for the rest of his life.
         But the one thing about it was that
         my great grandmother, who was a very strong woman, knew, OK, knew that all these people, all these people depended on my grandfather for different things, and, um, even when times were really bad my grandfather would great grandfather would help you know some of these really poor people out and there was this one couple this one guy who was just a really hard worker really nice person but he was having a really hard time and so my grand great grandmother and my great grandfather took a great big, anonymously took a great, big basket of food to their door and he knew that they would never take this stuff from anyone that they knew was one of those real proud people and so they took it like late at night and right before they put it down, my grandmother, my grandfather slipped 50 bucks, which was a lot of money back in those days, into the basket.
         And he never told or anything.
         Well the thing about it was in, I'm sort of telling this story out of order, but my grand, after my grandfather died and my great grandmother was sort of alone, um, it must have been right around Thanksgiving and she was feeling real depressed or whatever and this lady came and invited her to come to dinner, and when she, and so my grandmother didn't think she really wanted to go and everything, but she thought, "Well, OK," she'd go ahead and go.
         And so she went in.
         When she went all these people, all these different people from all over the place she said half of them, you know, I guess they, back then, I guess they called them vagabonds.
         A lot of them were just, I, or what we would call I guess homeless people but they were also people that they knew were there.
         And so my grandmother was talking to this lady saying they couldn't believe that she had prepared this meal.
         It must've been Thanksgiving, this meal for all these people and that she didn't know, and some of them she did know, and the lady said, well she said, well, what happened was several years back when she in her husband were having such a horrible time one night, they got a great big basket of food that had 50 dollars in it.
         And she said and that tied them over for the longest time, and they never found out who it was.
         And they thought, well once they got on their feet if they could repay people somehow.
         This is what they would do, and so they, you know, every time, this time of year, or whatever, they would have this meal, and, I guess, you know, she's just hoping that some day she would pay back the person perhaps that had given them that money, because she didn't know who it was.
         And she didn't know if it was a friend or a stranger, and this way they invited friends and strangers.
         And so she said that was why they had this meal every year between, it must be between Christmas and Thanksgiving, or something like that.
         And so my grandmother told me that, and, uh I, I thought it was just a really a nice way that this woman had, had actually, she didn't know it, but had repaid her kindness because it had been my great grandmother.
         But my great grandmother never told her that she was the one, and yet, at that time, that lady was inviting my grandmother, great grandmother over to this dinner and everything, um, anonymously.
         And I just thought it was just a really cute, or not cute but really sweet way to be thankful this time of year.
         So I guess that's a little confusing but I thought it was a good family story.
      
      
         Is that it?
      
   

   
   
      
         OK, this is my third interview with my friend Tabatha Lloyd who also lives in Lincolnton, NC, where I live.
         Have you lived here all your life Tabatha?
      
      
         Yes,
         all but six months and we moved to Robinsville.
      
      
         And where is Robinsville?
      
      
         Um, it's at the tip of North Carolina and Tennessee, it's in North Carolina but it touches Tennessee.
      
      
         And that's where you have family I think, your mom's family lives there.
         Can you tell us a little bit about it?
         
      
      
         Um, yeah, both my mother and my father's family
         all live there, and um, my mother and my father moved here with Duke Power, um, in about '73.
         I guess they moved to South Carolina first and then my dad was transferred here, and the, so the rest of our family lives there, um, and we're the only people who live here, and it's just a total redneck town.
         
      
      
         What Lincolnton or Robinsville?
      
      
         Robinsville, um,
         what, why is it redneck?
         I guess, well, the whole town consists of nothing but white people and Indians.
         Um, the only chain that is in the whole town is an Ingle's grocery store, we used to have Hardee's, but they took it out.
         We do have Papa's Pizza now
         , and the rest of it is just all family-owned businesses.
         There,
         there's probably, I don't know, the whole town consists of one block basically.
         It's just a big circle, uh, and, there's nothing to do there.
         If you want to go shopping you have to go about thirty miles, other than grocery store, um, you have to, everybody goes to Asheville to shop, because there's no, there's no stores to shop there except for just like family-owned, little clothing stores and stuff, stuff nobody wants.
      
      
         Isn't that where they filmed the movie Nell, and weren't your grandparents a part of that film?
      
      
         No, they, they did film the movie Nell there but, um, they, the pool hall was my uncle's pool hall that it was filmed in, but no my grandparents had nothing to do with it.
         Um, my uncle did rent out his pool hall, and in the grocery store scene, my aunt and my cousin are in the grocery store scene, and I guess that's all the family members I have in there.
         They've totally, all the tourists have destroyed the house, the little cabin in the woods where Nell was filmed.
         Um, they've just went up there and took planks of wood and stuff off of it and totally destroyed the whole place.
      
      
         Do you like living in Lincolnton, and the people here as opposed to the people in Robinsville, do you think they're nicer, um, I mean friendlier, and just in general do you like living in this area?
         
      
      
         Uh, I wouldn't live anywhere but Lincolnton, I don't think.
         But as far as the people goes, people in Robinsville are much friendlier.
         Th, like I say, there's no, you can't go shopping or anything so there's a lot of family time spent, you know, you, there's a lot a,
         a lot of visiting, and people take time for each other up there, there's not the hustle and bustle that's down here, so, life's a lot slower pace there.
      
      
         What about Lincolnton?
      
      
         Life's definitely fast paced here because everybody's always busy, an nobody visits anybody, we just don't have any of the old, the old school tactics I guess that uh, they practice in Robinsville.
         Nobody has time for people around here.
      
      
         Wow, and this is considered a small town to lots of people who might live in larger areas like even Gast--
      
      
         Charlotte.
      
      
         Yeah Charlotte, uh, did you like going to Lincolnton High School?
         
      
      
         Um, no, it pretty well, no, Lincolnton High School pretty well sucked.
         
         Um, I think I made it there like seventy-five days out of my senior year, and I still managed to graduate with my class with a B plus average.
         
      
      
         This is something we're all proud of Tabatha.
         
      
      
         Hey I'm proud that I got out a there.
      
      
         Um, OK, well, so, do you think you'll ever want to travel, or, and if you do, where do you want to travel to?
      
      
         I would like to go to Scotland I know, Scotland and Ireland, um, just because I think, the, I think the land's beautiful, I like the accent, and I just think it would be a neat place to go.
         I'm not really, Paris, Europe, doesn't really drill me, um, I'd like to go to Scotland and Ireland, and of course the Bahamas, or Hawaii, everybody wants to go there, but, that's um, I guess Scotland would just be the place I'd most like to go.
      
      
         OK, um, your mom also lives here in Lincolnton and I've never known a, a family, and I'm talking about you, your sister, and your mom, and your brother, who is more close in such a functional yet dysfunctional way.
         
      
      
         
            
         
      
      
         Tell me a little bit about your mom and the things that you appreciate in her, or things that you remember about her best when you were younger.
      
      
         Um, we are really close and I guess that's because my mom was a single mother who raised us.
         She had to work two and three jobs our whole life to take care of us.
         So growing up she wasn't really around much, um, but she's always been our best friend.
         Um, my sister's just always kind of, she's the middle child, and she's always just kind of took care of me and my brother.
         
         And, um, I'm the baby, so, momma just always left everything up to Tonya to take care of us, and that's why I guess we're so close, because we all had to depend on each other, and we didn't depend on anybody else to take care of us.
         We, we all leaned on each other and we all took care of each other.
         We're, we're all best friends, and it's kind of hard for other people to fit in, you know, it's the four of us and then everybody else I guess.
      
      
         OK, and what about your dad, do you, I know you're not as close with your dad as your mom even though you do love him, um, do you remember your mom and dad being together when you were a child, and, you know, holidays or anything like that, that you remember them being together?
         I don't, I don't remember how young you were whenever they got divorced.
      
      
         Um, I remember Christmas, some Christmases with my dad, um, because, I remember one Christmas we got every, we always got everything on Christmas Eve because my mom couldn't wait.
         Um, and I remember the day that um, I was five years old and I was getting ready to go to kindergarten when my mom told me that my dad wasn't coming home, and um, it was the summer before I went in kindergarten.
         And I was sitting in my dad's chair waiting on him to come home and, uh, my uh, momma told me daddy wasn't coming home, but uh, that's really the only two things I remember about my daddy being young, uh, I remember one other night, with uh, when he took my brother and sister to a, um, a race car, um, a race or something, but I stayed at home with my mom, and that's really the only three times that I remember my dad, before they split up.
         And as for my dad, you know he's a great guy, I love him, but he's set in his ways, and he's always right, he's never wrong, and you know I'm too much like my mom so we're not the best of friends, but that's my dad.
      
      
         OK, Tabatha, um, we spent a lot of time together when we were younger, um, a lot of good times, a lot of fun times.
         What are the, now that we're both two old married women, what are some of the things that you remember and miss about our younger days, especially our years in high school when we had to kind of rely on each other as nonconformists to the groups in Lincolnton High School.
      
      
         Um, I guess I miss going to church together because you know we were always in the same youth group.
         And of course I miss Galen Radebaugh, but
         , um, I definitely do not miss the short period of time that I had to live with you.
         
      
      
         Oh God.
         
      
      
         Because that was immortal hell!
         
         Uh, um, I miss making fun of Alynne I guess.
      
      
         I hope Alynne never goes to the Charlotte Narrative collection and pulls this interview up.
      
      
         
         Alynne we love you if you do, um.
         --
      
      
         Tell us about Alynne.
         
      
      
         Alynne was crazy, and speaking of my dysfunctional family, my, my brother was in love with Alynne and my brother's girlfriend wanted to kill Alynne, and Alynne was crazy and probably on Prozac, and, Alynne tries to kill herself you know, as we hear, she, she's constantly trying to kill herself, and, she contributes all her problems to the fact that my brother, I don't know,
         that she wasn't with my brother I guess.
         But Alynne thought she had beautiful feet and she thought that she was holier than thou, and,
         she, she was just a spoiled brat.
         Um--
      
      
         
         Golly!
         Besides Alynne, can you remember any fun things that we did together?
      
      
         Fun thing--
      
      
         What were the funnest memories.
         I know, I know I remember staying at your house, spending the night, ordering pizza whenever we didn't have any money to do so, and having to steal money from your brother, or just--
      
      
         Count out change.
         
      
      
         --count out pennies,
         , and, going swimming at the hotel where your mom use to work at night when nobody was there and we weren't really allowed to be there, that was fun.
         Um,
         so, what are your fondest memories.
         
      
      
         I have no idea.
      
      
         Oh that's nice.
         
      
      
         Um, I guess, I don't know, just hanging out, um, we use to hang out with like Steven Waites.
         I guess we had a lot of fun with Brad.
         We use to just hang out and have a good time all the time, we stayed with each other all the time, and, um--
      
      
         \\ You taught me how to smoke.
         \\
      
      
         \\ Yeah I taught you how to smoke.
         I'm sorry.
         
         \\
      
      
         \\Cigarettes\\, which we have both quit smoking, thank, praise the Lord.
      
      
         
         Um, I guess the funnest times we ever had I would have to say was right after me and Doug got married, but, I'm not going to talk about that so
         um, I don't know.
         Th, that was the really memorable times, um, seeing who could stand outside the longest on the deck in the snow--
      
      
         Oh I remember that, that was fun.
         It was never about partying, I mean we did party, especially after you and Doug got married, but it was never about that.
         I think when we had our funnest times, I mean those times were fun, but we also when, when we were involved in youth and stuff like that we had fun then too, so we didn't--
      
      
         Did you go to the beach with us?
      
      
         Fort Caswell, yeah--
      
      
         Oh.
      
      
         Like a lot of my other friends in high school all we did, was like party together and that's the only memories I have of them, when I ever want to remember something about them it's always, "OK, well, we did, we drank that night and did this that night."
         But, with you and you, and just, and maybe one or two of my other friends from high school really, we really had a friendship that didn't involve stuff like that all the time.
         We had good times without having to do that crazy stuff.
         So, I think that's good because a lot of people can't say that.
         But I digress, I'm sorry, anyway
         .
         Um, I've been asked, I asked dad and Linda the same question because it's such a cheesy question, but I'm going to go ahead and ask you, since we're coming upon the year two thousand, what was your favorite movie of all time and why?
      
      
         Um, I guess it would d, d, da, da, da, da, da, probably Dirty Dancing.
         It would be a close tie between Dirty Dancing and Up Close and Personal.
         \\
      
      
         \\
         Oh God.
         \\
      
      
         \\ But uh.
         \\
      
      
         \\ Please.
         Dirty Dancing.
         \\
      
      
         I, I just love Dirty Dancing, and um, it wasn't because I thought Patrick Swayze was beautiful or anything, it was, because I really don't think he's that good looking, I just, the story was sweet, and it was a good story.
         I always needed that older man to come take me away
         .
         Doug took me right here, to uh, Lincolnton.
         
         Um, and if it was Up Close and Personal it would be totally because of Robert Redford standing at the end of the escalator.
         
      
      
         Um, speaking of Doug, you guys have been together for how many years, not, not just including the years you've been married.
      
      
         We've been married for, for four, and, I guess we've been together eight years.
      
      
         OK we had to flip the tape over.
         Um, do you remember the very first time you ever saw or um, met Doug in high school, and can you talk about that a little bit?
      
      
         The first time I ever met Doug was at church, was at Covenant, and he came to church with a friend of ours Tammy Taylor, and, um, he um, he had, I don't remember if he had a mohawk then or if he was bald-headed, I'm guessing he probably had a mohawk, and had on a green and brown flannel shirt, I would guess, and he weighed a hundred and twenty six pounds and was six four, he looked like he was dying with AIDS,
         , he was pathetic looking, I felt so sorry for him, and he was a total freak, he did not talk to anybody, he was just a skater and he was just a total freak.
         And I decided I was going to be his friend, and I talked to him at church, but he was "Uh, uh," was all he would ever say.
         And then finally we had a class together when I moved and, because I switched schools in tenth grade and when I moved to Lincolnton, um, well to Lincolnton High School, I had a class with him.
         And um, he, the way we started talking is he had shaved his head bald, and he was going to let some of the guys draw a picture on his head with black magic marker and I felt sorry for him and I told him that they were not going to draw on his head, and we just started dating.
         And, the first time he ever called me, I was on the phone and he called, I was talking to my mom, and I switched over and I'm like, "MAMA IT'S DOUG," and he said, "Huh", I had forgotten to switch the phone over before I screamed in his ear.
      
      
         Were you excited that it was Doug or horrified?
      
      
         I was very excited, um, I liked him a lot though I just think really, I really felt sorry for him, and I just wanted to kind of take care of him, and now he takes care of me.
         And, um, you were talking earlier about being friends, um, one thing I think through being friends through the years and stuff and uh, not all being about partying, is we have a friendship that we, I think we'll always be friends whether we're always together or not, you know, It's not, a, it's not about you know, seeing each other every day or hanging out all the time, its deeper than that and I think that's because God's at the root of it.
      
      
         I agree.
         Um, oh, I wanted to ask you about your, I know you love kids and you've always worked with kids, since you've been out of high school you've wanted to pursue a career with child care development and why do you like kids because I don't see why but, uh, maybe you can explain to us why you like them so much.
         
      
      
         I don't know, I've always liked kids, I guess because I've, I guess it has a lot to do with the fact that I was the baby of the family and I've always, you know, I was always just the kid of the whole family, and, um, there was times that you know my dad wasn't around or whatever, and I just, there were times he didn't treat me like he should have I guess, and I just wanted to be good to kids and I just want to show kids love, and even if they have dysfunctional families, or if things aren't the way that they should be, that's, that they have somewhere to go, and somebody who loves them, and, um, you know, its not just kids it's you know, it's teenagers, I have a heart for teenagers and though sometimes that's got me in trouble, I still have a heart for them and I still, you know, someday really want to help teenagers as well as children.
      
      
         Um, OK, it's very understandable why, seeing it from that perspective why you like kids so much.
         Um, I'm going to ask you just maybe one or two more questions.
         Um, OK, one of our favorite things to do is to tell ghost stories and scare the heebie-jeebies out of each other, um, tell me one of your favorite ghost stories.
         You have a friend Jennifer who lived like way out in the boon docks, and some scary stuff occurred at her trailer, can you tell us a little bit about that.
      
      
         Yeah, well,
         um, I had, OK, Jennifer, I, it been like a couple days about a week or so and I hadn't had time to go up and see her and I spent a whole lot of time with her and her kids,
         this is before I got married, so you know I spent the night with her a lot, and um, we, we were friends and I went to lay down with her little boy one night to put him to bed because he wouldn't go to sleep by his self and I had worked all day so I was really tired and I went and laid down with him and me and him fell asleep.
         Well, Jennifer came back there and she woke me up, and, um, she said, "Tabatha," and I'm like "Um huh," and she's like "Tabatha get up and spend some time with me you hadn't, you know I hadn't seen you all week , please get up and talk to me for a little while," and I was real sleepy and I'm like, "OK Jennifer."
         Well I opened my eyes and I like tossed my head over to look at Spencer, when I opened my eyes she was going back down the hall, I tossed my head back over to look at Spencer because he was laying on the other side of the bed, and uh, when I did, Jennifer was in the bed with me and Spencer, she was laying down between me and Spencer or on the other side of Spencer, Spencer was in between us, and I woke her up, I'm like, "Jennifer you got to wake up now," because, and I told her what had happened, and that hadn't been the only time something like that had happened, um, there had been times when, um, we were like we were going to sleep or something, and, um, one night I'd spent the night with her and some stuff had happened that night I forget what all had happened but-- \\
      
      
         \\ Didn't you stay the night with her a lot because her husband worked at night, or, something?
         \\
      
      
         Uh yeah, he worked third shift, and, um, she didn't like staying by herself because you know stuff did happen a lot in that house, but, uh, I spent the night with her one night and Patrick w, was actually home that night and s, some stuff had happened, you know we'd heard some noises and stuff and she'd ask me if I would come sleep in their room, she's like, "I'll make you a pallet at the end of our bed just come in there, you know, um,
         um, I'm scared," so I'm like "OK Jennifer", and she made me a pallet at the end of her bed and we were we were asleep and I was almost asleep and all of the sudden we heard this noise and it sounded like it came from the bed, and Jennifer said, "Tabatha I hope that was you," and I said "no I was hoping that that was one of y'all," and she said, "No, it came from down there," and I said, "No, it came from up there".
         Well, she looked at the clock and she's like, "Tabatha, get up get up now and come in the living room," and we went in the living room and sh, and I'm like, "What Jennifer", you know I wanted to go to sleep, and um, she said, "Did you see what time it was?"
         And I said, "No I didn't see what time it was," and she said, "It was 2:15," well at the time that meant nothing to me, but um, she explained to me and later we watched the Amityville Horrors, and then it really started making sense to me, and speaking of Amityville Horrors, my house
         looks just like the house in Amityville Horrors, have you ever looked at it?
      
      
         Yeah.
      
      
         Um, but uh, um, and th, then some other weird stuff happened, and I really think the reason that such weird stuff happened there was because I was the only Christian influence in her life, and I think you know, I really believe that her house was possessed
         and I believe that you know they probably wanted to get rid of me, but.
         --
      
      
         Tell about her little boy knowing about her grandma.
      
      
         Um, um, he, one day her little boy who was about three years old um, his grandpa's his grandpa's father was dead, and well, by that time his grandpa's mother and father was dead, but one time he was talking to Jennifer's mom, and it was Jennifer's momma's daddy whose father and mother were dead.
         OK, so Spencer was talking to his grandmother and he told his grandmother, he said, "I know," he said, "Your grandpa's crying."
         She said, "My grandpa's crying, my grandpa's, hey, you know, my grandpa's gone."
         He said, "But he was crying and he was running through the woods and, um, um".
         Debbie asked Spencer, she's like, "Spencer, you know, what are you talking about?"
         Spencer had never heard about this, and, um, he said, "He's crying and he's running from somebody," and she said, "Who's he running from?"
         And um, um, and Spencer said, "I don't know, but he's crying, he's running through the woods, and, she," he said, "and she shot him.
         And um, Jennifer's grand, uh, Spencer's grandma asked, "Who shot him?"
         And said, "h, his wife shot him," and her, um, her grandpa had been shot and killed but they had never found out who had shot him, they never knew who had killed him.
         And then Spencer was three years old
         he had never heard it, heard them talk about it before, so I mean he just knew, and Spencer would sit, like he would be sitting in the living room a lot of times too and he would just look off into space and he would just get terrified and start screaming, and he would run to you and just cry and would be still be looking at whatever, he was just off in space like something was just scared him to death.
         And um, there was another one I was just thought about, oh horror stories, oh, Jennifer always told me also about this um, this woman who, she got this call one and she it, it was this little boy and he said, "Um, I'm lost and I can't find my way home, and can you call my mommy?"
         And, and um the lady said, um, you know, "Yeah I'll call your mommy, do you know your mommy's phone number?"
         And he um, s, he gave, he gave, um, the lady his, his phone number and he, she said, "Well where are you so I can tell your mommy where to come get you at," and the little boy gave her the address of where he was and said, "Please call my mommy.
         I'm lost and I want my mommy to come get me".
         Well, the lady called the little boy, the number that the little boy had given her and um, the, the lady answered the phone, or, I believe it was her husband actually who answered the phone and um, the, the lady said, "Ma'am, um, your little boy called here tonight," and she said, "Your little boy just called, your little boy said that he was lost and that he couldn't find his way home, and he gave me the address of where he was and he wants y'all to come and get him."
         And the lady said, "Ma'am," and the lady got really mad and she was really angry and she said, "My little boy's dead and I cannot believe that you would pull this joke on me," and the lady said, "Ma'am your little boy just called here and you know I would not play this joke on you."
         And she said, "Let me give you the address of where he said he was, because, you know, I would not make this up."
         And she gave the address, and the lady went, she gave the address, and, um, the lady told her, she said, "That's the house we lived in, where my little boy got killed at," or not had killed but I think he had died in that house or whatever, and, um, so um, the little boy, I guess, was just looking for his way home.
         Is that enough?
      
      
         Yeah, thank you Tabatha for those spooky stories.
         Now I have to drive home by myself.
         But, um,
         just wanted to mention again that that was Tabatha Lewis, Lloyd, sorry I'm use to calling her Tabatha Lewis, from Lincolnton, North Carolina.
      
   

   
   
      
         Few people are fortunate enough to be able to pinpoint life-changing events.
         Fortunately, I'm able to, to pinpoint one that happened to me because it happened in the recent history of my life.
         It happened to me in, in 1993.
         To give you a little bit of brief history, I came out of the 80s like a lot of people did, kind of floundering, trying to figure out some new directions.
         I'd been through a lot of violent up and down swings and created peaks and valleys in my financial life and emotional life, and, course I'm sure my, my mental frame, but everything settled down and I was going along, had a good job, was dating a lady.
         Just enjoying life in general, had a wonderful relationship with my two precious daughters.
         One of my hobbies/vices/pleasures was playing tennis.
         I played tennis out at Charlotte Tennis Club.
         I've been a member out there for quite some time, primarily playing men's doubles and men's singles.
         Played a lot more men's singles in the 80s than I did in the 90s; as we had gotten older we seemed to migrate more towards men's doubles.
         Had a group of guys that I played tennis with on Monday nights, and, at the time, Thursday nights and Saturday and Sunday afternoons for quite some time.
         On one particular Monday night we were playing mixed doubles, played against, played beside, rather, a group of women, all of whom I knew and we'd kind of kidded because this was a group of very attractive women, three of whom I knew, but the fourth one I didn't know.
         Like I say, I was playing with some friends of mine and, and I was literally smitten, almost like a sixteen-year-old, by this new woman, so much so to where it was very, very difficult for me focus, on my game that day and I was pretty much a, a weak link in the match for that entire period.
         Well, could never catch the eye of this new player, so the match was over, their match was over, they left, I left, and just kind of went on with my life.
         Well, a few weeks after that, I ran into one of the other ladies there who, along with her husband, were friends of mine and I asked her who that person was.
         And she told me who she was; she said her name is Sally Trull, she lives in Gastonia, she's married, I mean she's, uh, divorced, and has three children.
         And she said, "And she's looking for somebody who plays tennis and has a sense of humor."
         And I said, "Well, that would definitely be me," however, at the time, I was dating someone and didn't think too terribly much about it.
         Well, low and behold, several weeks later I received a call from this lady, asked me if I wanted to play mixed doubles on a Friday night.
         It would be she and her husband against myself and Sally.
         So I said, "Certainly."
         We all agreed to meet at the club at six o'clock.
         Well, I got there, Sally was there, she had come straight from work.
         However, our club closes on Friday nights so she wasn't able to get in, which wasn't that much of a hindrance.
         The real hindrance was the fact that she had left her tennis shoes under her desk at work, so he, she had showed up to play tennis with all of her equipment, her racket, and no shoes, which is just a very, very bad combination.
         Well, we had no choice but to get shoes.
         Of course she, at the time, was living in Gastonia and really didn't know her way around Charlotte very much at all.
         So we decided to go to Omega Sports, which is at the Arboretum.
         We were at our tennis club, which is over near Quail Corners Shopping Center, it's really not all that terribly convenient.
         So we hopped in my car and rode to Omega Sports to get some shoes.
         This particular ride was probably the most crucial point in our relationship.
         Both of us are quite gregarious and we talked to each other a good bit.
         And in the 15 to 20 minute ride to Omega Sports, as well as the 15 to 20 minute ride back from Omega Sports, we both gave each other a very good thumbnail of our lives and where we were and what was going on and, and the type person that we were.
         It was very informative to me I could feel a very, very strong attraction to, Sally, but I knew I had this other relationship going on, um, and didn't really want to do anything to jeopardize a potential relationship with Sally because of the other relationship.
         So, we went back, played our match, and as has always been the case with Sally and I, or most of the time has been the case with Sally and I, we won this match.
         After it was over, everyone wanted to go out and eat, but I couldn't because Jocelyn was at home.
         And I said, "I can't, I really thought this was just a tennis match, I've got to go home, my daughter's there."
         So, I went home, didn't hear anything for a while.
         A couple of weeks later, Sally called and invited me to go to Jazz Fest uptown.
         
         She explained a story about a group of people from work and I think maybe they'd even rented a van, um, and were making the rounds, I can't remember all the details of it, but she said, "and I thought maybe you'd want to go," and she added this cleverly, "unless you're seeing someone else."
         So I was honest with her, told her I was and that it was in the process of winding down, um, but I really appreciated the invitation.
         So we, once again, parted ways.
         Several weeks later, after the other relationship had run its course and had been completely wound down, um, I invited Sally to go to a, um, I think 25th anniversary party with some, some people that I worked with.
         Um, we ended up getting together that Friday night before, to meet some other friends of mine to kind of give her a baptism by fire.
         Um, and she played tennis at our club on Saturday, and then we got together and went to the anniversary party, and ended up out with some friends of ours after that was over, and, I think, basically spent the entire weekend together, and I just became closer and closer and closer to her.
         I know that I fell in love with her that weekend, um, and ever since then, she has been an absolutely fantastic part of my life, very integral to the person that, uh, I have become.
         And it's just been an amazing period of time to me that I was so fortunate to find so much of a, to use a very corny term, "soul mate" at that particular point in time in my life when I'd really kind of thrown a towel in on that.
         Um, but that's, that's a little story about how I, uh, I met my wife, uh, how important she is to me, how things just kind of clicked, all because she left a pair of shoes under her desk and sent us off on the relationship where we are.
         Now, um, thank you.
      
   

   
   
      
         Hey Jessica, this is Sally.
         I thought I'd talk to you for a few minutes or eight, maybe starting about my grandparents.
         You never got to meet my grandparents, neither did your dad, actually.
         But I had four of the most awesome grandparents in the world.
         I called my mother's parents Nana and Didad.
         Didad never took a music lesson in his whole life, but he played in a band.
         That's where Tommy got his musical talent.
         Nana was one of the sweetest, most incredibly sweet and giving people in the whole world.
         Little, tiny lady, she wasn't even five feet tall.
         She was one of 19 children, which is just amazing in today's world to think of a house that full of children.
         My dad's parents were Memaw and Pop Pop.
         Right now I want to talk to you about Memaw that's m-e-m-a-w cap the first m and it's all one word.
         Pop Pop, by the way, was incredibly awesome too.
         He took us out to Holiday Inn breakfast for pancakes every single Sunday that we were ever around him.
         He didn't take up golf until after he retired.
         He was such a fun person.
         But Memaw is the one that used to tell stories.
         Memaw was one of 17 children.
         Her dad lived on, well, I'm sorry, the whole family lived on a farm, her dad worked on a farm.
         He didn't own it, he just was one of the workers.
         So you can imagine that they didn't have a lot of money.
         Memaw said she was only spanked one time in her whole life and that's when her pet pig died.
         Well her pet pig died because she snuck it in the house, took it upstairs, and gave it a bath and it died of pneumonia.
         The only other time that Memaw said that she got into trouble was when it was her job to bring the cows in at night.
         And this one particular night she just wasn't into it.
         You know, she just didn't feel like going up on that hill to bring those cows down.
         But she had to, so, the obedient little person that she was, she did it anyway.
         Well the cows wouldn't cooperate they just would not hurry down that hill back into the barn.
         She got mad at them so she tied their tails together so they would stay together and come down the hill.
         Well with their tails tied together coming down the hill along came a tree and they straddled the tree, one went to the right one went to the left.
         Course the tails were tied together, they got hung up, the knot wouldn't come undone but one of the tails did.
         I don't know if it's true or not but that was one of the stories she told us.
         The other story that she told us one time, when we asked her about her upbringing, brought us all to tears because, like I told you, her father worked on a farm, they didn't have a lot of money and yet they had 17 children.
         That's a lot of children to feed when you don't have a lot of money.
         So, her father had to walk her down the street, she can remember holding his hand and walking down this dirt road with a little suitcase, and in it was everything that she owned.
         And he took her to a neighbor's and she became their foster child.
         I think that they actually had to do this with some of the other children also.
         So from then on in, Memaw was being raised by this couple and was happy and had a good time there and a good life, but about a year later, this couple was killed in a car wreck.
         Memaw was born in 1898, so I guess this foster family was tooling around in a Model T or something, but they were killed in a car wreck.
         So then they had to find another place for Memaw to live.
         Now this farm was in WV and I don't know how they found this next family, but there was a family in Baltimore, MD that wanted to adopt her.
         So off she went to Baltimore, MD.
         And it was a wonderful, wonderful man who met her at the train station, took her to his home.
         She said she had never seen anything this big in her house, I'm sorry, in her life as his house.
         She walked in the front door and there was this great big tile floor, the foyer had a huge ceiling and a spiral stairsc, staircase.
         So she climbed the spiral staircase with him to her bedroom and just couldn't believe it.
         They had dolls all over the room for her and a great big bed that was all hers and she really did have a wonderful life.
         This gentleman put her through nursing school, Memaw became a nurse, was working in the hospital, and was taking care of this one patient in particular, a woman who had just given birth to twins and had complications.
         So in the weeks and months that she was ministering to this lady, a young girl actually, she was also getting to meet the family and it was, and was, becoming involved with them.
         The lady died.
         The lady's brother was my grandfather, who she later married, and they raised these two children like their own in addition to the other five children that they had.
         Memaw had to quit driving once she had children of her own because they cried every time she took, drove, drove the car.
         So she never drove again.
         She died when she was 96, as did Nana, and both of my grandfathers died of heart problems when they were each 72, that's kind of amazing.
         So that's one little story for you.
         Now I can tell you about the story, I can tell you the story about how I met your dad.
         I was playing tennis at Charlotte Indoor Tennis Club with my girlfriend Sandra Nyy, that's n-y-y.
         Sandra now lives in Singapore.
         Well Sandra and I were getting ready for a tournament and we were practicing with Glenn Pennington, a lady, and Julie Calman, I think.
         And there was other people out there, I didn't know anybody except for Sandra and Glenn.
         Well there was this one guy out there, who was really cute, that had twinkly blue eyes and he was playing on the court next to us.
         And I was in one of my little phases where I really didn't want to have anything to do with men because I'd just had a really horrible experience and it just, I didn't have room for it in my life right then, but I did think he was cute and I asked her who he was.
         And she told me.
         Well, we played tennis the next week.
         The first time we played was Thursday, then we played again the next Monday, and low and behold there he was again, although he wasn't on the court right next to me, but I noticed him, and I noticed he kept looking over at our court, but I wasn't going to make eye contact because that was flirtatious and I was way too shy to be flirtatious.
         So we finished playing and I watched him walk behind our court and onto the common area and speak to someone.
         And I still wouldn't make eye contact with him.
         But I still asked her who he was.
         Well about a week later I get a phone call at work from Glenn Pennington who asked me if I would like to play tennis that Friday night, mixed doubles with she and her husband against me and this guy named Hugh Lowrance, and I said, "Who is Hugh Lowrance?"
         She said.
         "Don't you remember?
         That's the guy at the tennis club that you asked me about."
         I said, "Well have you called him?"
         And she said, "No, I haven't called him yet."
         But I think she told him that she hadn't called me yet either, so I don't really know who she called first.
         Anyway, I said, "Sure, I would love to," and he said, "Yep, that'd be great."
         So I show up at the tennis court Friday night before six o'clock so that I won't be late.
         Didn't want to be too fashionable, you know.
         Well Friday was casual day at the law firm where I worked, so I had on my nice little linen shorts and my nice little shoes and a cute little top.
         Well the parking lot where I worked was two and a half blocks away, so we would oftentimes wear our tennis shoes in because that's a long hike in heels or whatever, and I had walked in, in tennis shoes, my tennis shoes that I was going to play in that night and promptly left them under my desk downtown.
         So here I stand at the tennis court with this man, looking oh-so-cute dressed all in white with a little white vest, who I've never met, and we're talking like two little magpies, and I said, "We have a problem."
         He said, "Yeah, I see the door to the club is locked."
         I said, "Well we have a bigger problem than that."
         He said, "What's that?"
         I said, "I don't have any shoes."
         He said, "What do you mean you don't have any shoes?"
         I said, "Well I left them under my desk at work."
         He said, "That's no problem.
         We'll go get it.
         Where do you work?"
         I said, "Downtown."
         He said, "We have a problem."
         See he hates to go downtown.
         So he put me in his car and we went to the nearest Omega Sports and bought me some shoes.
         And the girl that waited on me, I was able to tell her, "This is a blind date.
         I've made a hell of an impression already I know," as I said tongue in cheek.
         And she said, "Oh, my gosh!
         Well he's cute so," she made sure I had hangers in the dressing room and I tried on a pair of shoes and they fit, put on my tennis clothes and we were back at the court in 15 minutes.
         That was impressive.
         But we had a neat opportunity to talk in the car and we talked and laughed `cause we were both kind a nervous and kind of silly, and we go out to play tennis and we're still being silly and talking and laughing and playing against our good friends Glenn and Fred, who we never should've lost a game to as we proceeded to lose the first set because your dad couldn't keep the ball on the court, basically.
         Ha, ha, but I know he'll say the same thing.
         Anyway we decided we weren't going to lose the match, so we settled down and we played and won and had a good time, and I thought, "Well cool.
         I bet we go out to eat now.
         It is Friday night, it's about eight thirty or nine."
         But nope, your dad goes, beelines it right for his car gets in the car and leaves and doesn't even ask for my number.
         Well it wasn't that unusual that a guy didn't ask for my number, but I knew we'd had a really good time.
         So I was kind of, um, surprised.
         But my little antennas perked up and I said, "Girlfriend, girlfriend," you can put that in quotes because that's what I was thinking.
         So I decided to make him tell me that he had a girlfriend.
         Actually, I was just looking for another excuse to call him.
         So I picked up the phone about two weeks later and called him and told him that Jazz Charlotte was going on, nope it was called Jazz Fest, and that the company I worked for had a shuttle bus, which it did, and people signed up for it and you got to go to Jazz Fest, and it was a lot a fun and, and I said, "I don't know your status.
         I don't know if you're dating anybody at the time, but if you're not and you'd like to go, I would love for you to be my guest."
         And he said, "Well you know, I would really love to go, I really mean that, but I am dating somebody right now and I can't."
         I said, "Well that's all right, but I had a great time playing tennis and maybe I'll see you over at the club sometime."
         And he said, "Cool."
         And I hung up the phone thinking, "Darn I wish could meet somebody just like him that didn't have a girlfriend."
         But about six weeks later I get this phone call from someone asking for Chrissy Everett identifying himself as Jimmy Connors and it was, guess who?
         And he said there was a party, an anniversary party for some people that he worked with and did I want to go, and he was sorry that he didn't get to go to Jazz Fest with me, but he had been dating somebody and it was somebody that he used to be engaged to and then wasn't engaged to and they had reconciled, but he knew it wasn't going work out, but yet they were still dating when I played tennis with him but, they're not dating anymore.
         And I said, "Well cool."
         So we went to the party and we had a great time and we've pretty much been together ever since.
         And I bet I've talked for eight minutes, but I hope you enjoyed my stories.
         Talk to you soon.
         Bye.
      
   

   
   
      
         OK, um, just to give you a little bit background on my heritage my mother is French and Italian, and my father is American and German, but I am a born native of Charlotte, NC, if you can't tell by the accent.
         
         Um, I have traveled back and forth to France.
         Uh, the story that comes to mind the most for me, um, I guess in my life, is the story of my grandmother who's now presently 85 years old, and actually, had flew down here the Friday after the tragedy, so it was, um, I think it was the fourteenth of September she flew by herself from France to here to visit us, and is still here until December 24th.
         Um, her story actually is what impacted me the most in my life, um, when I think of the things she went through growing up, and, um, how my mother was conceived and everything on that nature, which it gets a little personal, but it's, you don't think of your grandmother telling you that, but she did.
         Um, my grandmother and my grandfather was in the error of the war, and so they were constantly moving.
         My grandfather was Italian, full-blooded Italian, and he was, um, a prisoner of war for a while.
         Um, he did escape and get out, and so him and my grandmother were like, he would travel, get missing, and come back, you know, but he would always be back with my grandmother and everything.
         And there was one particular incident where they were, um, there were bombs going off, because again, this was like in the war with the Germans and so forth.
         Um, and they thought, they literally thought they were going to die because they were on a train, and the train, part of the train that they were on wasn't hooked to the caboose.
         So when the train pulled off to get from away from all of the stuff that was going on, they were left behind.
         So they thought they were going die, so they decided, I guess
         , what better way to die than, um, to make love on the train, and that's how my mother actually was conceived, was on a train, and my grandmother had told me about that, you know, the different things they went through with that.
         Um, OK, um back to me.
         When I grew up my mother taught us French.
         It was me and my sister, and she taught us French before she thought us English.
         Um, and I remember as a child mixing the two languages, like I might say a sentence in French and throw in two words in English, um, because we learn French in the household, and then English in school.
         And all my life she constantly brought us back and forth from, um, France to, um, America, um, to visit my family there.
         So I still am fluent in French and I am very thankful for that, um, because recently, when my grandmother came to visit, she has never had heart trouble, and, um, never had anything go wrong with her heart or anything, and one day, while she was here, which was, here recently her heart rate dropped real low, so we had to, um, rush her to the emergency room, and this was something very scary for her because she doesn't speak any English.
         She speaks like one or two words of English, um, not to mention, she doesn't like to, going to the doctor, so it was like we had to hit her over the head to bring her there.
         But, um, we finally got her to the hospital and they, um, ended up doing surgery on her that the next day, and placing a, putting a pace maker, um, so for her, you know, to be here, you know, and get treatment under, under those circumstances was kind of scary, but she's doing better.
         OK, now she's supposed to still be going back December 24th.
         Um, and when they say it rains, it pours because my mom, um, recently moved back in with me, but I don't know how long that will be, but, um, she did and she had been up one night from, she had gotten up one morning at like five o'clock in the morning.
         By the time I had got home from work, and so forth, it was like 11 o'clock at night and she was extremely tired, but my mom is one of these people who constantly has to go and do something, she can't sit still, it drives her crazy.
         So she thinks she's going to make, you know, she moved all her stuff back in my house, and she thinks she's going to clean it up all in one day, so my house is like a tornado hit it by this time, but, you know, I'm fine.
         I haven't said anything about it because, you know, I know it's going take a few days, but she wants to do it all in one day, so she's still up at like 11:30 at night, going back and forth between the attic, which, you know, in the, in, the attic is in the top of my house.
         You have to climb a ladder, a pull-down ladder, to get, to it, and I was telling her, you know, she'd needed to be careful, she needed to go to bed because she was tired, and, furthermore there is like a hairline crack in my ceiling in my bedroom, um, where apparently she had stepped wrong or stepped on the wrong place or something before, and it created a hairline crack, and I was telling, and I stressed to her, you know, "Be careful," you know, "don't step in this area."
         There's a hairline crack in my ceiling.
         So I'm sleeping, midnight, you know, it's past midnight, and all of a sudden, I hear this big loud noise
         , and I look up and she's hanging through my ceiling.
         
         And here's her feet dangling, and, of course, it startles me, but I'm a very quick reactor, so I jump out of bed, and I was pushing her feet up so she wouldn't fall all the way through my ceiling, um, but, mind you this is after I told her to specifically not to walk in this area, but I tell you if, you know, anything about my mom, it's like I can talk to the wall better than I can talk to her and tell her something.
         But, so then, if that wasn't bad enough, um, we were in the hospital and my instincts told me not to let her drive my car, but I'm thinking, you know, if my friends can drive my car from time to time, then why can't I let my mom drive my car from time to time?
         Dumb question because I know my mom and I know how she drives and she's doesn't, she's not careful but I'm thinking the hospital is 10 minutes from my house.
         OK, so I'm thinking 10 minutes from my house, what can happen?
         Well she's gone, and no sooner than she comes back, what do she tell me?
         "Oh I hit something."
         She hit something.
         So not only has she torn a hole in my ceiling, which still isn't fixed, by the way, but now my car is all dented up.
         
         So I'm just like, "Lord, by the grace of God, just let me get through this."
         But, um, you know, she felt real bad about it but this was after I specifically told her.
         I'm like, "Mommy, you know you're real emotional right know," I'm saying, you know, you know, "upset, and be extremely careful, what you're doing, you know, when you drive my car home," and she said, "OK, OK."
         And then she comes back and she was like, "Don't ever let me drive your car again," and I was like, "You do not have to worry."
         
      
   

   
   
      
         Hi my name is Alexis Manser.
         I was born in 1980 in Warren, OH.
         My family is actually from Niles, OH and I'm half Lebanese from my father's side and half German on my mother's side.
         Um, when I was young my, the story that stands out most in my mind is this story that my dad would tell me that he learned from, I think it was one of his uncles, Uncle Joe or Uncle Johnny.
         And, um, it was a story about this character named Jehilehi.
         And this is obviously just some made up name my, uh, great uncle came up with, but, and my, my dad loved these stories as a child himself and related them to me when I was a kid.
         And--
      
      
         Sorry, can I just ask you how old you were when you heard these stories?
      
      
         Ah.
         Well I guess my dad started telling me these stories when I was about three, four up until whenever, still, I mean sometimes he'll be joking around at the dinner table and still tell me these stories.
         But, um, and the thing was Jehilehi was this hero, this brave guy and he had this motorcycle.
         And
         he, he would always be saving a woman from some bear or something or some, some, some wild creature.
         And he would, you know, at the climax of the story my dad would, you know, the stories were always varied and they were improvised never the same plot but he would, you know, get on his motorcycle and speed away into the mountains and fight this bear, and save the damsel in distress, and they were just pretty exciting stories, especially when you are a kid, you know?
         And then, um, my mom, I remember her.
         She would read me a lot of books actually and, and she would sing me a lot of songs.
         She wouldn't actually make up stories out of the blue, but, um, and the songs that she would sing, um, I can't remember the name of this one but I always remember it was about.
         I sort of remember the words, but she told me them when I was very little, like, I don't know, like four or five, maybe even younger and it was always about how, um, her and my dad loved me so much and there was always, I don't know.
         See there was candy in the story.
         I just remember, like, it about, it was being about candy and sweetness stuff like this.
         Uh, sorry I'm being vague, but, and, um, she would read me, um, a lot of Grimm's fairy tales often, and the one I remember most is, um, the one about the, oh what was it, the one with the, hang on a second.
      
      
         Hansel and Gretel?
      
      
         I now recall the stories she would read to me.
         It was the one about the girl, the dancing shoes, or something like this these princesses had, uh, cast a spell, cast on them and they had to dance all night with these shoes and until the shoes wore out and their feet were all sore.
         And then, finally I, I forget how the story went, but I always remember her reading me this one story and I just loved it.
         And she, oh well this, this I guess both my parents imparted to me was this, this album they that we used to have.
         It was, um, actually the story of Hansel and Gretel and they, I think I would like listen to it everyday because I just loved it and they would put it on the record player and, ah, I would sit in a little rocking chair that we had in our living room and listen to it, and I was kind of scared at the part where the witch was going to put them in the oven, but
         , and my dad would come in and he'd sit with me and comfort me.
         But I loved it so much even though it was scary to me, I don't know why, but, um, and also, actually my grandma, which I call Situ, and that's "grandma" in Arabic.
         She, um, told me stories about when she was young.
         When I was a kid I would ask her like, you know, where, where she grew up and what it was like in her neighborhood, and she would tell me that, oh when she was little that all of her cousins and all of her, she had a big family, her sisters and brothers and stuff.
         They all lived on the same street in Youngstown, OH.
         And back then, Youngstown, supposedly she tells me, was a much nicer place than it is these days.
         You know, crime capital of the world.
         But, um, she, she would tell me about how, the kind of trouble they would get into, and, and how strict her parents were.
         And if she, she would go to the store and buy them bread.
         And one day she went to buy them bread and she came back with the incorrect change and so her dad got very angry with her and made her go back to the store and, and I guess the guy had given her too much money back and she hadn't told him that he had made a mistake and so she got in trouble way, way too much trouble, you know, unnecessary trouble, and she had to walk all the way back to the store, and I don't know, she just made it out that to seem like in a lot of ways, back then, times were, seemed so much better, and yet so much harsher in a lot of ways.
         And supposedly, you know, it snowed more back then and, ah, but, you know, family was closer knit, I guess, so, you know, pros and cons in every, every case but and my, my grandpa, called Jidu in Arabic.
         He told me stories about when he was in the war he flew a fighter jet, and he, well when I was young he never really got much into the details, being as I was little kid, but he would tell me, um, about the buddies he met, um, during the war and some of the turmoil and stress it caused him and, um, my family on my dad's side, as, I guess you can tell now, is obviously a lot closer than on my mom's side, ah, because my grandparents on my dad's side, well his parents had more kids than my mom's parents did and, and also my mom's, ah, parents died when I was too young really to remember anything they would have said.
         Um, so ,so also, um, my dad's sister and brothers, they spent a lot of time with me when I was little and they, they made up little tales about
         my, my dad has, has a very imaginative and inventive kind of family and they would always be making up these characters and telling me stories about them.
         Like Fred Fredimecusson and, um, Connie, Connie, Bujane and um
         um
         , oh let's see Ralph Rasselbossum and--
      
      
         And how old were you when they told you these stories?
      
      
         Well I was, the age at which they told me stories, just, it varied.
         I mean it was really pretty much all through my childhood, you know, up until I reached a certain age to where I didn't find it so interesting anymore, but, um, I guess it would be somewhere under 10 or 12 that they would tell me these stories, and, um, it usually would be at night and we'd be back in this little bedroom I always would sleep in.
         And when I'd stay the night at my grandparents house it'd be a holiday and all the aunts and uncles of mine would be at the house, and they were always very loving and, and, you know, actually, um, some of the stories I remember very much so were the ones that my Uncle Dave would tell me.
         We'd, we'd build a bonfire outside because my grandparents they lived out in the country and we'd build a bonfire and he would always tell these scariest ghost stories and he would make everyone of them up and they were so incredibly intricate.
         The plots, I just, I just remember, just being so well told.
         We would sit around the fireplace, my cousin Matt and my cousin Jamie and Jeremy, and he would tell me these stories about, you know, this boyfriend and girlfriend.
         I remember this one where one day they were, um, they were driving down the road, and actually I think this one might be a generic tale, but, uh, um they went to a gas station or something, and the guy gets out of the car to pump gas and the girl's been sitting in there but it's been a while.
         So she looks around for him in the parking lot and she doesn't see him and she's worried, you know?
         Because he's spent, you know, going on minutes and minutes now.
         And, um, so she gets out of the car to find him and the gas station attendant runs out of the, the, um, the gas station and he tells her not to get back in her car.
         He's like yelling at her, "Don't get in your car!
         Don't get in your car!
         !" And she's, she's scared because this guy's all frantic and so she runs around and gets in the driver's side and she decides to drive off.
         Well she's driving down the road and she going down this dark country road.
         And he said the name of it was Duck Creek Road, which was actually a road that my grandparents lived on.
         He's trying to scare us even more.
         And the girl, the girl, um, stops underneath this tree to catch her breath she's really nervous and scared.
         She doesn't know where her boyfriend is and she hears this after a little while she's sitting with her head on the steering wheel she, she, she hears this thumping on the top of the car--
      
      
         Sorry, can you just give me one second?
         
      
      
         So she gets out to check what this noise is and she's, she's looking on the car she sees nothing, and so finally, she sort of warily looks up and sees her boyfriend hanging from a tree limb and his leg is brushing against the top of the car and she's, she's so obviously scared at this point.
         She screams she runs down the road just to get as far away from the scene as she can, and, honestly, after that I don't remember what happens but something
         happens.
         And anyways, the point is my, my uncle told these stories so much better, and he, he, just the way he talked and the way he enunciated certain words, and the way and the level and pitch at which he would speak was just he was amazing.
         So, uh, thank you, thank you for this time for listening to me ramble about my stories.
         I hope you have a wonderful, wonderful day.
         Thank you.

         Female Voice START OF TAPE 1, SIDE A
      
      
         Hello.
         My name is Kevin McCloskey and, um, I'm 15 years old and, um, I've lived in Charlotte since I was born, and, um, my parents are originally from KY, and I have relatives up there that, that have some pretty crazy stories that, um, my grandmother used to tell me about her brother, which was, he was autistic and, um, he did some funny stuff.
         Like one time his sister got a doll for her birthday, or something, and she wouldn't let him play with it.
         He kept bugging her and bugging her and she just wouldn't let him mess with it, you know.
         And so, he threatened, he said, "I'm going to go sit in the fire!"
         And she said, "Go ahead!"
         So he goes and sits down inside the fireplace with the fire on.
         He got third degree burns all up his back, went to the hospital, you know, he's pretty crazy.
         He keeps a goat in his front yard because he doesn't like to mow the lawn.
         It's pretty funny.
         I mean, it's nothing to laugh about, but, you know.
         Um, he can play the harmonica like it ain't nobody's business.
         Uh, that's why they say he's retarded, but I really think he's autistic because he's really good with musical instruments.
         Um, they tell me pretty crazy stories.
         My mom said when she was little she had, um, she had a little puppy and every, everyday it would run around the yard.
         It would just run and run.
         And she watched it everyday, run, run, run, run, run until it couldn't run anymore.
         Just fall over on the steps, you know.
         And one day she was mowing the lawn and they used to have a little push mower instead of, um, like an electric mower, and, um the dog hit it and the dog split in half.
         Like straight down the middle.
         And my mom, she was crying and everything and she took, I forgot what the medicine was called, but it was that stingy medicine that really stung when they would put it against you, and, um she poured that all over the dog and wrapped it up in bandages and, um, she put it in a box and the next day she heard it barking.
         So she ran over to the box and, um, when she saw the box she, uh, she saw that she had put the dog on backwards so its legs were facing two different directions.
         And then, because she was trying to rush it, you know, trying to keep him alive, she said he would run on two feet, he would run around the whole yard, whole yard and as soon as he would get tired he would jump, do a flip, and go on the other two feet and just keep on running.
         That's pretty funny.
         I don't think it was true though.
         And, um, my grandparents, my father, my grandfather, he used to be very wealthy before the Depression and, uh, this one time his father played the world champion billiards player at that time.
         And they, they played about three games and he cleaned him out all three times, you know.
         The other guy didn't even get to touch the ball.
         So, but, um, my grandmother had 10 siblings and, um, she used to tell me when they were little there used to be a creek over by their house, and, um, she used to run, they used to get vines off the tree and just, they would swing on them, and like every week some kid, just being stupid, would break their arm or break their leg, break fingers or something and go crying home.
         And the parents are just, they would never show them, they would always have the perfect swing but they would always point to a bad one and they would just cut them down and just have it, and everybody would just keep breaking their arms and stuff and, um, I don't know.
         I just thought that was pretty cool.
         There's no real end to that story.
         Um, I don't have one story in particular that they told me, I mean they're kind of short but I can just tell you a bunch of short ones.
         Um, when I was little my mom used to tell me this story about a monkey that lived on a pirate ship.
         His name was Ketchup and, um, everyday the monkey would always lag behind, you know, he would always drag when the other monkeys were running real all fast.
         And they would always go, "Ketchup!
         Ketchup!"
         And this happened everyday, every single day.
         And the monkey kept getting, you know, he was tired of being left behind all the time, he never got to do any of the fun monkey stuff.
         So, um, one day he got roller skates and, uh, one day they were like, "Ketchup!
         Ketchup!"
         And he went and he put on his roller skates and he beat everybody back to the pirate ship.
         And then they were like, "Wait up, Ketchup!"
         And, uh, now that I think of it, that wasn't the greatest story but I thought it was cool.
         Um, I my grandma always said, my mom and dad they would always, they said, uh, my grandparents said that my mom and her brother were just like the greatest children ever.
         And my mom would tell me as soon as they got done, as soon as their parents were out of the room they would just start going at it.
         They would pull each other's hair and fight and cuss and yell at each other, you know, fighting, and, uh, my grandma was always, um, she always thought they were real nice.
         They still fight to this day, not bad but they'll argue every so often.
         Um, and my other grandpa, um, he used to tell me about how he used to fly in the B-52s, and he said, uh, he had to escape about three times.
         One time he went and, hold on, sorry, anyways he would, he told us he had to parachute out of the plane about three or four times, I can't remember.
         But, um, he said he used to have a friend that could speak German and he jumped out of the plane and he landed in the French, with the French Army and, um, he um-
      
      
         Who you talking to?
      
      
         -he had this friend that could speak German and, um, his friend, you know, he fell in with the French and the he was like, he said something in German because he thought they were the Germans and he was like, "Yeah, I'm a German.
         I'm just s, spy for Germany, spying on America."
         And the French people tried to attack him because he was, um, because he was in Germany.
         But, um, my grandpa he jumped out of a parachute one time and he told the people that his boots were too big when he got them but they were like, "Wear them anyways!"
         When he jumped out of the plane his boots fell off!
         But see that's pretty serious because when you land he could break his ankles easy!
         But, uh, lucky for him, he fell in like a vineyard and fell into a tree and it was in the, I want to say it was in the Mayor, or maybe it was in the equivalent of a Mayor over in France, and, uh, they hid him for about three or four weeks from the German, from the Nazi troops, um, just to save him.
         But he used to tell me often about his brother, which, who was a Green Beret, and he, um, he, everyday they would take him five miles out or six miles out and just drop him in a different place everyday.
         They had to find their way back to camp.
         Um, and he said one time, one time he got about seven purple hearts, but, um, I remember one time my grandfather would tell me, I thought it was pretty cool, but, um, he um, he um, he was fighting, you know, the German army and, uh, not the whole German army, but, you know, he's fighting a platoon, him and a few of his Green Beret buddies.
         Um, and um, he went and, I'm not sure if this was the Korean War or Vietnam War, but, um, I mean, not Vietnam but World War II.
         But, um, whatever happened, he was, his whole team went down and he was around quite a few dead people, and he pulled a dead person over him.
         And the people saw him and so they shot a bullet through the dead person and it, um, it went through his mouth and, but it didn't break any of his teeth or break his jaw, it just went through his mouth and he didn't make a sound.
         And that's how he escaped.
         So I thought that was pretty neat.
         Um, I don't really know.
         There's a lot of stories that he used to tell me, but, um, I remember hearing when I went to a carnival one time, a story that was pretty good.
         It was, it was about, if I can remember correctly, it was about a cat's tail.
         And it was something like, uh, Taily-Po or something and whatever would happen is whoever, uh, I don't even remember, I think it was like who somebody cut the cat's tail off and he ate it and every night he would hear, "Taily-Po, Taily-Po!
         I want my Taily-Po!"
         And finally one morning he woke up and his belly had been cut open, but, uh, I don't think that's how it went because I was little when I heard it.
         Maybe I made up my own things too.
         I do that, I make up my own stories sometimes.
         You know, I'll do something like I was in a baseball field one day.
         Oh!
         I remember what I used to do when I was little!
         I used to, the stories I used to tell.
         The stories I used to tell my babysitter was stuff like, uh, well today in gym, the gym teacher made everybody do back flips and I was the only one who could do it all the way around the gym when I was five years old, I mean, and, um, and I thought she believed me, but, um, I just hadn't learned about sarcasm yet.
         But, um, also another story that I used to tell people, but wasn't true, was that when I was little my dog, my little dog ran me over and stepped on my nose and gave me a scar on the side of my nose because I couldn't think of any way to do it, any cool way of making my scar, of how it got there, and so I just made up stories.
         I did that a lot.
         Um, I used to, um, I used to like hearing stories from, mostly from my mom.
         I heard some stories from my dad about sports, but, um he used to tell me about when he played baseball.
         Some of the stuff, I believed it all, but I mean some of stuff, it was like, you know, you want to make yourself sound better than you really were sometimes.
         I do it all the time.
         Um, like the other day I got a hit in a baseball game.
         It was a hit, but I just, it could have been counted as an error or a hit, and I just made up a story about that.
         So, but, um, uh, I don't know too many Charlotte stuff, I heard some stuff about Charlotte.
         Um, oh yeah!
         I remember this story when I was in pre-school that I really liked!
         It was about this, this, uh, little guy and his name was like Tee or something, I don't remember.
         And he, um, one day he was walking with his, uh, walking with scissors and he snipped his finger and cut his finger and it hurt, and, uh, he would never let his, um, he would never his mom let him get his hair cut because he was scared that it would hurt too bad.
         And I always thought that was pretty cool.
         But, um, I don't know, I always liked ghost stories.
         I remember when I was at Camp Clear Creek when I was in Cub Scouts, there used to be a, there, there's the lake Bebe Parker, it's more like a big pond but we called it, it was a lake.
         It was Bebe Parker Lake.
         And Bebe Parker was a boy that, um, got sucked into a drainage pipe one, one day and, um, he died.
         And, uh, every year I'd go there, they would take the whole troop out there and I'd be so scared!
         And they'd be out there, they'd be like "Bebe Parker!
         Are you there?"
         And then you would always hear, "Help me!
         Help me!"
         And I was really scared.
         I was always so scared of that.
         And I never knew how they did it!
         And I always thought it was really scary, and like the next day we would run down and try to talk to him, try to talk to Bebe Parker, but, uh, Bebe Parker wouldn't ever talk to us back.
         And we always thought he must be sleeping.
         And then when we were, I think Webelos or whatever, they're called the highest you could be in Cub Scouts, they would they gave us a, uh, they let all the Webelos be Bebe Parker and all it was, was a big storm drain behind the, there was like this big opening down the hill that they couldn't see from the hill they couldn't see it from up there and you just yelled into it, "Help me!
         It's Bebe Parker!
         Help me!
         Save me!"
         You know, and stuff like that.
         We would scare all the little kids.
         And I was so amazed because I thought it was the coolest thing.
         And we used to go snipe hunting when we would go talk to Bebe Parker.
         And the Scout leaders would go, "I see a snipe!"
         and he would jump on it and he would shake the bag, like the big trash bag, around.
         Everybody would be yelling and screaming, "Agh!
         It's a snipe!"
         And then, um, it was pretty cool, I used to always try to catch snipes too.
         I wasn't very smart when I was little.
         I wasn't very, I don't know, I was book smart but I wasn't too clever.
         I believed people, silly stuff too much.
         But, um, eh, I don't know, I used to like to read the stories about the Berenstain Bears a lot.
         I liked the one about where, were at, or he, where they went to the movies and there was, they went to the ballet movie
         .
         They, they, um, went to the, I forgot what it was.
         It was like, I guess it was equivalent of Power Rangers pretty much, and it was like a Power Ranger movie, but it wasn't.
         And um the, the brother and sister bear, they both had nightmares about each other's stuff and it crossed over.
         It was really neat but, um, the end.
         My name was Kevin McCloskey, I was, I am 15 years old and I was born in Charlotte.
         That's all I have to say!
      
   

   
   
      
         I'm going to, um, tell you something about my, um, cousin, whose name was Deirdre, and, ah, I, I, I'll give a little bit of background, just, it needs to, it needs to be put into a little bit of a context.
         Ah, I was very, very fond of my, my cousin, um, she was, she was a very beautiful person, both physically and, and spiritually.
         She was very tall, she was very elegant, um, and she also just, she had a, a radiance about her, it was really, ah, irresistible.
         She had an irresistible quality, she just drew people to her.
         And, um, she was, her, her mother was my father's sister, was highly neurotic, dramatic, dissatisfied woman, who had been married a couple of times before she married Deirdre's father and, uh, when she married Deirdre's father, he had, he was, he was a, a, a very sort, ah, of reclusive, um, scholar.
         He was a philosopher and also a psy, uh, a psychologist.
         And he, he was a professor at, at, um, Hunter.
         But he came from a, an extremely exclusive family, um, they were, his name was Livingston Welch, and it, it's a very old American family, the Livingston's and the Welch's.
         And when they combined the families, they, they, ah, he was sort of their, the legacy is in him, was that he was Livingston Welch, both families.
         Anyway, he was a real character, Uncle Livingston.
         And a brilliant man, uh, but, incredibly eccentric.
         And he had been in love with my, with my father's sister since they were very little.
         They grew up on, on Long Island, sort of in Great Gatsby-land.
         Um, in Sand's Point.
         My, my father's family were, were in a little area called, um, Plandome, which is next to Manhassett, which is right next to Sand's Point, and Sand's Point is, is perhaps where the, the richest people in America live.
         And, um, they, ah, they knew each other and he was in love with her, but she wouldn't have anything to do with him.
         She, because he was, he was a nerd.
         
         A very rich nerd, but a nerd!
         
         And um, my father's family were probably nouveau riche in, in, in their estimation.
         My, my, my father's, um, my father's parents were both English.
         They didn't meet in England, they met here, but both, both of their families had immigrated to this, to this country and, um, they, my, my grandfather was in banking, and, um, they, he made obviously a very nice income.
         But not quite on the level of the Welch's, um, who subsequently lost all of their money, which is always the way it is, in life.
         Ah, but, anyway, so there was this whole social thing.
         And they were, they were a part of a social milieu that my father's family were close to but not quite in.
         And, um, ultimately when my, when my aunt finally went through her other husbands, ah, she decided that really she was ready for some social status, and perhaps some money, and so she acquiesced to, to marry my uncle!
         
         And, they had a very peculiar marriage.
         And, at some point along the way, and I don't know the historical details, they, the Welch's did lose all of their money, and they, they had had this beautiful mansion on, on Sand's Point, um, and it was right at the very tip of Sand's Point and they had an absolutely beautiful town home in, um, in Manhattan on 65th Street, ah, right between Park Avenue and Lexington Avenue, so it was the sort of the place to be, so to speak.
         And eventually they, they were, Livingston, in his older, in his old age, was relegated to the,
         to the kitchen in the sub-basement of the building because they sold it to, to some woman in New Orleans, but they'd kept that part of the building and he loved it, that was, for him that was like, that was the greatest.
         Ah, by that time, he and my aunt were living in, in, uh, you know, sort of, uh, uh, an apartment in, on East 57th Street that was just one of those sort of, those little run through apartments.
         And it wasn't a bad apartment, but nonetheless it was, you know, not certainly my, my aunt's idea of why she might have been ma, been marrying my uncle
         !
         It wasn't quite what she had in mind.
         And they had also stuffed all of this really beautiful furniture, um, from all over the world into this tiny
         little apartment, so it was very cluttered.
         Ah, and ah, first she, she got pregnant and I don't know how they ever managed to consummate the marriage because by the time I knew them as a couple they were, um, my aunt dressed all in black and, uh, she, as I said, she was very neurotic, she was also very, very dramatic and everything was over-stated and, they obviously could, couldn't stand
         each other by this time, although they were never rude to each other, they just lived completely separate lives.
         And she hurt because she had worn really high heels, and she'd been a model when she was, she was, she had been really, stunningly beautiful, in the thirties, and, um, when she had modeled.
         And uh, but she had worn these really, really high heels because she was incredibly vain, and her arches had fallen
         , so she had to wear these big, thick black shoes which she hated.
         
         So she would be sort of roaming around the, the apartment with all of her, her drama and her, her overstatement, and my uncle, who barely ever came home if he could help it, ah, would live in this one tiny room at the very, very front of the apartment that overlooked 57th Street, and, uh, he had nailed down the windows because he didn't want to have any fresh air because he, he believed that fresh air was really bad for you.
         
         But he basically spent all this time in the, in the kitchen in the sub-basement of what had once been his family home.
         And he had a, a German mistress, um, who everybody knew about, ah, who sort of took ca, took care of him and looked after him and adored him, but my aunt couldn't be bothered with him.
         Anyway, out of, out of this wonderful marriage he'd produced these two daughters, one of whom was Deirdre who, as I said, just was this incredibly beautiful person.
         And, ah, my, my family are, are Episcopalian, hardly practicing, but nonetheless that's my, my grandmother had been a very, uh, very religious woman and she, she was, she made sure that, that all of the children were, were Christened, and, um, and that certainly my sister and I were, um, Confirmed
         .
         The Welch's were Catholic.
         And, ah, for some reason, and I don't know who made this decision, Deirdre, both Pamela and Deirdre, my two cousins, were sent to, ah, Catholic school in Tarrytown and, um, they for some reason, according to my aunt, who was very hysterical about the whole thing, they always recruit some of the young women into the convent according to her
         .
         So, as I said, you know, Deirdre was extremely beautiful, very elegant, and all of these things, so she was not perceived as, as being a candidate for quote, as the family put it, "to escape from the world," but to be out there in the world with all of her, her charms and graces and, and what have you.
         And, ah, anyway, she, she decide,
         she said that she was, that she made this decision that she was going to go into the convent, and become a nun.
         And, of course, everybody in the family was absolutely hysterical and put out about this, but my, and my aunt, her, her, her, her response to the whole thing was that she needed to see a psychiatrist, meaning my aunt needed to see a psychiatrist to get her over the,
         the pain and the loss of her daughter having made this decision.
         So, uh, but anyway, Deirdre was really, she, she, she was a, she really believed that that's what she wanted and that was what she should do.
         And, uh, as I go along, I'll, I'll talk a little bit more about, you know, my, my family's interpretation of this whole thing because that's part of what when I, when I think of Deirdre and I think of the loss of Deirdre, some of what I try to come to terms with is why, why my family interpreted her choice the way they did.
         But, um, because the, the general consensus was that she was too scared or somehow felt insecure and she couldn't be a part of the world they never, they never said, "Oh, she, she did this because this is what she believes."
         You know, it was simply that, "Oh, she doesn't know what she's doing, and she's misguided, and she's scared," that was the general consensus.
         Anyway, she became a nun, and, um, I would go and visit her.
         And, um, she was, she became, she was a teaching nun, she taught in a school, um, Marymount was the name of the, uh, of the convent and, and the school, and they had a, a school in Tarrytown but they also had a school in Manhattan.
         She ultimately ended up teaching art, because she was a very, very gifted artist, um, at Marymount.
         And when I would go over, first she was at Tarrytown, initially, and I would go over and I would visit her from time to time, and it was always just a joy to, you know, to see her.
         And at that time, this was, this was before Vatican II, and she was fully garbed and it was, and it was strange, because I had been very close to her, I was very little when, but she was very, very kind to me, and she was always very interested in me and would take me places, and include me and so it was strange for me to, you know, suddenly see her in, in, in, um, all in black, ah, with profuse robes, and, she had a, the, um, head dress was very, it was, it was shaped like this, it was, so you, um, really could not see very much of her face, so that was, that was a very strange thing for me, but she always seemed happy.
         So in that context, I never questioned it.
         You know, it was just wonderful to see her.
         And, um, and then there was a part of it too where I felt like she looked beautiful in wearing what she was wearing.
         I mean they were, they were in some way just, the garb is very medieval, and it's, it's, it is certainly more interesting than some of what we wear, you know, in, in that sense.
         But, so there, as a child, there was that kind of, uh, a sense of it was strange but it was also interesting, you know.
         Um, at some point she was sent to Spain.
         And at that time, Spain and I, and I am not very good on dates and, and, um, historical happenings, but at that time Franco was, was in, um, was in control in Spain and they were, there was, there was, the Church was not, um, was definitely repressed, and there was a lot of political things happening.
         But that's where she was, and so there the family was obviously concerned because she was in a, in a country that was under a lot of strife and conflict and, and, she was an in a part of an institution that was definitely, not only not supported, but was actually persecuted.
         And, um, she at that time she contracted cancer, but nobody knew about it because they, um, th, th, the situation in Spain was, was such that there wasn't a lot of medical, um, assistance for, for nuns and other, uh, members of the clergy.
         So it, it went undiagnosed.
         By the time she came back to this country, um,
         she wa, she was diagnosed, and she had cancer of the uterus and she was completely, I mean she just was, she was very, very sick.
         So they had to operate and they ha, they took out everything.
         Um, and uh, but of course, you know, it would be obviously more
         of a tragedy if she was somebody who was planning to get married and have children.
         So she was, I think that she was, she was comfortable with it in the sense that she, it wasn't part of her destiny, so to speak, but it was, it was still a very traumatic thing to experience
         .
         And then, she, she was, she, she was, because she was convalescing, they, she stayed in New York, they, they didn't send her overseas again.
         And she, she was teaching at Marymount and I would go in and visit her.
         And, um, she, she was also taking classes at the Art Students' League, and I was taking classes at the Art Students' League, so we would pass in the halls, and she would show me what she was doing, and, um, and as I say, she was a very gifted artist, and she loved teaching and again, she still seemed very, you know I never got a sense with Deirdre of there may have been discontent
         , there may have been a sense
         
            that maybe she had made wrong choices, but, um, she never expressed that.
         At some point this was, right about the time of Vatican II, because she started to wear different clothes, and it was, it was very, um, it was very discreet, I mean, she didn't suddenly just go out to Bloomingdale's and buy a whole lot of, you know,
         fashionable clothes, but, when I would go in to visit with my, um, with my aunt, and if she was, if she was there, she was dressed in, in, um, very, very, uh, very elegant but understated, you know, suits and things like that, but she definitely was no longer in the full garb.
         And, uh, my aunt at that time had, was diagnosed as having lung cancer and she was very sick.
         So Deirdre took, was, took a leave from the convent, she was given, um, permission, to, um, for temporary leave, and I don't know logistically how that works, but she was, she was allowed to go home and, and be with her mother, to help her, um, go through, she was going to die, I mean everybody knew that she was going to die, but to be with her through that whole period, and, um, she did have some operations.
         And, um, at that point Deirdre made the decision, and her mother did die, and it was, it was all very traumatic, my father was very sick, he's a manic depressive, so we were going through all of that, and he was very upset with the medical profession for how they were treating my aunt, and this and that.
         But anyway, Deirdre made the decision that she wasn't going to go back to the convent.
         And she had already taken final vows, so it was a big, it was a huge thing, for her to make that decision.
         But she did.
         I never sat down and had discussions with her about it, so I don't really know what was going on in her heart and in her, in her mind.
         But she made the decision that she was going to, to leave and she, and she started to, she continued to teach, she, she continued to do the things that she was always doing but she just slowly started to, to live what would be considered a normal life.
         And she started to date and, she had several boyfriends and, uh,
         she was, she had met this one, this one person, and they were going to a, some kind of social gathering, in, in Rye, New York.
         They went out and on the way back, ah, it was late at night, um, they were on the, on the train platform waiting to take the train back into the, into Manhattan, and this, this man, who was drunk, and his car went out of control and hit both of them, and they were both thrown against the, uh, the railroad tracks.
         And you know there was no train coming, but they, they hit the rails, their, and she, both of them had severe head injuries
         .
         And, um, she went to the hospital and at first they thought his condition was much worse than her condition; they felt fairly, um,
         and I remember we got the, the phone call came, it was late at night, and my father, who was a, was a psychiatrist, but he was a neurologist psychiatrist, so um, anything to do with, with the brain and the nervous system was, um, something that he was an expert on, and he went over and ah,
         the prognosis at that time was that sh, they thought that she would pull out, um, but she never did.
         
         And she, she was in a coma for a week, and she just continued to decline whereas this, the man that she was with, he, he got better, and he was really in worse condition when, when they brought him in, and yet he, he regain, he regained, and within a couple of days he'd regained full consciousness, and he, you know, and she just, she just, um,
         she just never came back.
         And, um, I just had a, I had a feeling that she made a decision not to come back.
         And she died when we were there, my sister and I were there and, she just suddenly just she just let go, and she just died.
         And I think she died because she knew we were there, and she made a decision for some reason that she didn't want to live in this world.
         And, um, I've often pondered that ev, you know, that
         this whole thing about, that she, that she became a nun because she didn't, um, she was scared to live fully in the world.
         That there was something wrong with her, that she made that decision, that that was, that was the impression, that it was like the worst thing a person could, could decide to do.
         And I, you know I, I can't ask her because she's not here, but, you know I wonder well, "Why, why was that always the interpretation?
         I mean, why wasn't, why didn't we as a family try to support her more in the decision that she made, and to see that maybe, that there was, that there was, that she wasn't trying to run away from the world but that there was some greater truth that she was somehow privy to, that she was actually running towards?"
         And, um, you know, I, I, I wrote a long poem, actually, a twenty page poem about this, and I, you know, I, my question to, you know, to her, would be, you know, "Were you happier when you, when you actually left the convent and you came into a world that was just, you know
         uh, striving after money, and social status, and all of those things, I mean, was that, was that really a better choice, you know, was that really, um,
         you know, did you, did you feel more alive, making that choice, and actually dying, under those conditions?"
         
         But I can't ask her, I can only just go on asking myself, sort of rhetorically, you know, When did you feel more real?
         And then you know, the question for my family is, "Why couldn't you accept her decision?
         Why couldn't you believe in what she was striving for?"

         Uh-huh.
         My--
      
      
         Your earliest recollections that you remember?
      
      
         Jumping off a building.
      
      
         Jumping?
      
      
         It gave you a sort of high.
      
      
         A tall building?
      
      
         Well, tall to me then, but it wasn't really all that tall.
         Um.
         
         Playing in the woods.
         
         Which you can't do nowadays there isn't hardly, there isn't any.
         Um.
         [long pause]
      
      
         Well, what you mean?
      
      
         Well.
      
      
         What was the automobiles like and stuff back then?
      
      
         The first one I ever saw had a bird braid, with a part of the A model.
      
      
         Model T?
      
      
         No, there was the A model.
         A. And my uncle had one.
         They made a funny sound, "click, click, click, click."
         Um.
         
         There was a, let's see.
         Five of us then, my brother lived with us.
         We lived in this little two-room house.
         Five people.
      
      
         Five people in two rooms.
      
      
         Um-huh.
      
      
         Did you have wire, electricity?
      
      
         Yes.
      
      
         Oh, well.
         
      
      
         They had a fireplace in that little house.
         It looked more like a little dollhouse then a, you know like a little playhouse or something.
         
         It had two porches on it.
         
         And um, we had rabbits.
         Pet rabbits and I had a pet chicken.
         And I taught a pet and asked her where her eggs were.
         And she would take me to them.
         My dad sold them to the grocer and I wouldn't ever eat another chicken that came from the grocery store.
         I was afraid I`d be eating my pet.
      
      
         I don't--
      
      
         That's right.
         
         I was afraid I would be eating my pet.
         And so I never ate any more chicken from that grocery store.
         I remember down in the woods.
         I had this like a--.
         Partner.
         Stepping on them flowers.
         And climb them trees.
         The taller the better.
         Guess I was a tomboy.
         Tammy was too.
         
         
         It's a small thing, but Daddy was an alcoholic.
         And sometime good times and sometimes not so good times.
         
         It's pretty good up and until he was a truck driver.
         And went along on them long hauls sometimes.
         Went up to New York and everything.
         And get snow bound.
         Got gas in the truck.
         Driving a truck to him was like a habit or something, you know.
         He'd hear the sound of a truck and tell you what it was.
         That's a white.
         That's a diesel, and then he couldn't drive it anymore.
         
         He became a plumber's helper, you know and it killed him.
         He had about a fifth grade education.
         [Long pause]
      
      
         How's that?
      
      
         I remember we were coming up to Charlotte to visit.
         They still had um, the way they delivered milk was in a,
         with a horse.
         The thing they pulled.
         I can remember waking up to the sound of the horse, "Clip, clop, clip, clop."
         And I don't know, it sort of made you feel secure.
         And that's the way they brought around ice too.
         They didn't have any refrigerators then.
         Maybe some people did, but most people didn't.
         
         And believe it or not that was in the 40's, 50's.
      
      
         That's during World War II?
         You probably don't remember that do you?
      
      
         Um-huh.
         No.
         I know I was living then, but don't know.
         I remember some little things.
         They were playing war games, near our house in Wadesboro and they got, them guys got Mama to bake them a cake.
         Is that twenty minutes of recording?
         
         
         Well, I just told you that Daddy was an alcoholic.
         So, when I was a teenager.
         I was so embarrassed, you know my friends would come by.
         It's a small town.
         So everybody knows that he's one of the town drunks, I mean there were quite a few of them.
         And I told Mama that it was darn right embarrassing he'd get drunk, you know, like in the summer time and then he'd get as far the yard and pass out.
         I told Mama it was embarrassing for my friends to come by there, ride by there, there he was laying in the yard passed out.
         So the next time he started to lay down in the yard Mama told him, she said, "Clayton, if I were you would not lay down in the yard and go to sleep."
         He mumbled something or other and laid down in the yard and went to sleep.
         She took him by his feet and we had steps to go up on the porch.
         And pulled him up, his head going, "Bump, bump, bump," all the way up them steps.
      
      
         It's bad when you don't even feel it.
         
      
      
         Oh, he was saying: oh, oh, oh.
         He felt it.
         
      
      
         He was just to drunk to do anything about it.
         Wasn't he?
         
      
      
         Drinking I don't understand.
         They say they drink to forget their troubles and then that's all they talk about.
         
         Me, when I'm drinking I get sick on the stomach.
         My mother said that God has blessed me and made me that way because I could have been like Daddy and could have been an alcoholic.
         
         I can't understand how anyone likes the taste of it.
         
         Where's the boys?
      
      
         At home.
      
      
         When did you, uh, get married?
      
      
         Huh?
      
      
         When did you get married?
      
      
         Well, I came to Charlotte to live with my grandmother.
         I was engaged to a boy in Wadesboro.
         But I came up here and--
      
      
         So you were running from him.
      
      
         No.
         I came up here to work.
      
      
         Did you mean to leave him?
      
      
         He left me first.
         He was in prison.
         He went to prison.
      
      
         Oh.
      
      
         And I'm still writing to him up here, but I met George Watkins and I really don't know how to pick men.
         He um, believe it or not I met him in the church, but he turned out to be a paranoid schizophrenic.
         And his doctor said he was dangerous and it was best that I got away from him.
      
      
         But you didn't listen to his doctor, did you?
      
      
         Yes.
      
      
         No, you waited until he ran you out the door.
      
      
         I was out the door that time.
         I just had on black shorts and red shirt and I was a witch.
         Living with him you had to be careful of what you wore.
         What colors.
         How you picked up anything on the dresser and put it down or you were arranging some witchcraft stuff.
         The reason the doctor say I shouldn't live there is that.
         Um, he thought the bible said, well it does say don't suffer a witch to live, so he might kill me.
         I was teaching ya'll, my kids witchcraft too he said.
         
         Well, like I told you Tammy I could tell bits and parts of my life story and make, I don't know how many books.
         If I could just get into it, sit down and think about it and do it.
      
      
         Sitting down and writing it should remind you of some of the battles.
      
      
         I would read the True Story magazine sometimes and think, "Good gosh she didn't have it any rougher then I did.
         And why did she go out and become a heron addict or--"
      
      
         Was your whole life bad or did you have anything good happen?
      
      
         I had fun.
         I danced.
         Um, I sang.
         And my best friend was Eleanor Ruth Hare.
         And
         we went everywhere together.
         Well, we didn't go to many places because we couldn't sneak out that much.
      
      
         You were quite an artist too.
         You love to draw women's clothes.
      
      
         A designer is what my teacher said I ought to be.
         I did.
         I'd draw them, Sarah my older sister, would make them.
         
         Um, when I had fun was after I went to work for Schmick in wiring electric duck heaters.
         I had fun doing that.
      
      
         You loved that job.
      
      
         I love wiring electric duck heaters.
         And--
      
      
         You love the people too, it was like a family.
      
      
         Um-huh.
      
      
         Made you feel at home.
      
      
         And then they closed out the electric duck.
         You know the heaters.
         The wiring they say just um, air conditioning units and all those things were big and everything, but I still enjoyed working there because I knew the people.
         I worked there for about ten years.
         And then--.
      
      
         You made very good money for people during that time too.
         For a woman.
      
      
         Yeah.
         I was the only woman in that place making the kind of money an inspector made.
         Electric duck heaters.
         But the men weren't jealous of me like they said you know that they were.
         Most places.
      
      
         \\ The men-- \\
      
      
         \\ The men helped me get the job.
         
         \\
      
      
         I noticed that about mine too.
         They helped.
      
      
         They taught me what I ought to know.
         To get the job right before I was to go for the interview they told me everything I suppose to know when I went in there I knew it.
      
      
         That's good.
      
      
         They said, "You got it on your own.
         You remembered things real well."
         
         I had been going over there and helping the temporary inspector anyway.
         
         We had to learn about the air gauges, how much air would go in them things that make those, I can't even remember the name of them now.
         Fly open and shut when you put air to it.
         
         And then, I married Earl and along came Nicole, call her Buttons on there so--.
         And um,
         that made me stay young I think, Nicole.
      
      
         You got with her what you couldn't have with us.
      
      
         Because I had to work all the time with them.
         I worked quite a few with Nicole too.
      
      
         But you got to do more--
      
      
         Went to the beach a lot.
         
         At that time I had kids of all ages, one grown up, one thought she was grown up, and
         Amy was just real quiet,
         Nicole was never quiet.
      
      
         You had all girls.
      
      
         Um-huh.
         
         I had a miscarriage.
         Swore it was a boy.
         
      
      
         All the people during that period, the 50's.
      
      
         I was born the last you know '39, so '49, I wasn't nothing but about 10 years old.
      
      
         So the 50's were when you were a teenager.
      
      
         Um-huh.
      
      
         What did you wear?
      
      
         At the last of the 50's?
      
      
         What you wear the most?
      
      
         What I'd wear?
      
      
         What music did you listen to?
      
      
         I listened to Chuck Berry, Fats Domino, Little Richard, uh,
         Elvis Presley, The Platters.
      
      
         Elvis wasn't your favorite was he?
      
      
         He was everybody's favorite.
      
      
         Everybody's favorite.
         
      
      
         Except the daddies
         and mamas.
         Mama liked him pretty good.
      
      
         What about your boyfriends.
         Boyfriends liked him?
      
      
         They liked his music.
         They didn't particularly like him.
      
      
         They didn't like the girls liking him so much.
      
      
         Um-huh.
         They liked his music.
         Earl likes his music.
         And, um, Elvis,
         Elvis is sort of a legend.
         If he had become a preacher.
         He had the charisma to.
      
      
         \\ To bring in the sheep.

         Tell me about Elma Ruth before she run away from training school.
      
      
         She came to me then I hurt her feelings because I told her she couldn't stay there, but I was staying with Sarah.
      
      
         How old was she?
      
      
         15.
      
      
         Why was she in training school?
      
      
         Um, she was with this girl named Barbara and they told,
         they looked older then what they were.
         Although the guy at the car lot should have asked for their driver license.
         And they use to let you take the cars and drive them around with nobody in them, but now you know they stay with you.
      
      
         Yes.
      
      
         And they went on a joy ride in it.
         
         They took the car and went on a joy ride.
         But, it was called stealing because they didn't take it back.
      
      
         They didn't give them any warning or probation like they do nowadays?
      
      
         Well, she'd, Elma had a lot of warnings about school.
      
      
         She didn't go to school?
      
      
         Playing hooky.
         
         They put her there.
      
      
         You said she was beautiful.
      
      
         I thought she was.
         She had jet-black hair.
         I mean it was black as ace of spades.
         And a pretty complexion, but I got along better with her then I did with my sisters.
      
      
         How long have you been friends?
      
      
         Since when we were little tiny things and sliding down the bank--.
         Red mud in little white panties.
         
      
      
         When did you stop seeing her?
         When you moved to Charlotte?
      
      
         Well, we saw each other after I moved to Charlotte when I go back down there to visit, but when she moved to um, some,
         I can't think of the name of the place.
         Just lost touch with her.
         She got married and moved.
      
      
         So ya'll were friends on up until you were teenagers.
      
      
         Um-huh.
         I talked to her one time when I lived in SC.
         My daughter Debbie gave, called her, found out where she was, what her phone number was and called her and had this three way calling and we talked to each other.
      
      
         It's quite common now, but it was new when Debbie done it.
      
      
         It, it wasn't the same.
         I guess you just can't go back, but I still would like to see her.
         But when we uh, drive through Wadesboro going to the beach and everything, nothings the same down there either.
      
   

   
   JBM: Let me see. Um,
   my, my mother she died, you know, before I really, you know, knowed her. I was small, my brother, it was just the two of us, you see, and my grandmother didn't have but five girls, she didn't have any boys. And out of the five girls didn't but one have children and that was my mother. And then she had a girl and boy, Babe and myself. Babe was older than I was and I was second. But when she died she was 35 years old, so they told me. And, um, was then when I got up, you know, and they told me she died when she was 35, I knowed I was going to die when I got 35 years old!
   So I got scared! Yeah, I knowed I was going to die. But I said it, it, uh, you see what, when Babe and I was going, Babe was, would want me to, he'd go out with them boys and children and learn, you know, things. Well he'd want me to do everything, he'd come back and want me to do it. He'd want me to, to, wanted to try to learn me to ride the bicycle. I always was scared of everything, you know. And he'd get mad. Well they'd go out there and they'd get rabbit tobacco-
   
         
            JBM: -and they'd chew it, come back, and he have me, want me to
      chew it, I mean smoke it.
      
      
         
            JBM: And he said, "Just blow it in, then blow out," then maybe I'd go choking.
         I'd go to coughing and go out there and then he'd get mad at me!
         
      
      
         
            JBM: "Oh you can't do nothing!"
         
         Honey!
         Oh, we'd have a time and fussing!
         And then of course, you know, he was awfully mischievous and anything that was done, you know, "Who did that?"
         He'd put it on me.
         They would believe everything, because, see, he was the only boy and they catered to him, you know, he was the only boy.
         Honey, and I'm the one had, I'd have to get a whipping.
         They never believed nothing I said, but whatever he said, it was the truth.
      
      
         
            . JBM: Well then, after he got up pretty good size, you know children, they'd have little parties, you know, and things like that and they'd ask, you know, tell, ask for Babe and myself both to come and Babe would tell me, "No she can't go.
         That's not for her.
         She can't go."
         I never would get to go to nothing, honey.
         
            JBM: One year, Christmas, say, he going to get up there and say a little speech, you know,
      and then, we had, you know, a little store out, well it wasn't far from us, you go out a little dirt road, you know, and then you'd have to turn, turn to your right and then back to your left to the little store.
         And she'd send me to the store and I'd have to repeat it, what I was going after
      all the way to the store so I wouldn't forget!
         So much sugar, I'd have to say, "Ten cents worth of sugar," so whatever it was, I'd have to say it, you know, if I didn't I'd forget.
         Well one day at the, the little girl lived up above me, Charity, well she was going the store with me.
         Well along the road there just was this vine, just covered, you know, `long there, that big pretty vine there.
         So Charity said, "Let's, let's get some of it and rub it on us."
         I said, "No."
         She said, "Yeah."
         She got some made like she rubbing it on her face.
         Well I got some and rubbed on my face and it was, you know, // poison ivy!
         //
      
      
         // Poison ivy!
         //
      JBM: Honey!
         And my face!
         Oh it was a sight!
         And Charity didn't have a little, little place and honey, my face puffed up!
         And my mother she had to use, I don't know what all, it taken her for the longest to get my, honey, because I rubbed it in, you know!
         I thought that, she was making that she was doing it and I was so dumb, you know!
         
            JBM: I didn't know no better!
         
            
				JBM: She was a little older than I was, you know.
         Yeah, just dumb, dumb, dumb!
         
            JBM: I didn't know!
         
            JBM: I thought, I thought everybody was like me, tell the truth!
         My mother, you know, she was my foster mother.
         But she tell me, she say, "You tell me a lie, I'll kill you!"
         Honey, and I thought, I didn't know she was lying there herself!
         I know she didn't lie, honey.
         Honey I was scared to tell her
      `cause I'd know she'd kill me, you see!
      
         
         JBM: Yeah, baby, I know!
         And then one time, then, when I went to school, you know, well they would, well, you know, we'd have to carry our lunch everyday and then you, you had a boiled egg, and you'd have a baked sweet potato and, uh, these little, uh, little old sausage, whatever you call them, you know, what I'm talking about, because I see them now in the store.
      
      
         Uh-huh.JBM: Then that little, them little cans, the stuff that you make sandwiches out of, uh, Vienna sausage?
      
      
         Potted meat, or Vie-?
         JBM: Yeah.
         Potted meat, and, and then them little sausages, you know.
      
      
         Uh-huh.JBM: Well, I'd taken, I think, I don't know what they put a egg in that potted meat or something but anyway they'd make sandwiches, you know.
         And, uh, so then when I get to school, you see, I didn't like nothing but the white of the egg.
         And I'd have at lunchtime, they was all, was out begging for yolk, begging for the yolk!
         
         Oh I had plenty!
         I had plenty
      when they got ready to eat lunch and this one was begging, this one was begging.
         I didn't say I'd give you this day, tomorrow, give you that da-, they would all be around me for that egg!
         
         Oh Lordy!
         One time then they, uh, they was, uh, one little girl there and she was and so they was, I think they must have put her, you know, you know how children say, "Why don't you hit her?
         Why don't you get her?"
         When you start walking home?
      
      
         Uh-huh.JBM: So they put, put Josephine, that was her name, and I told her, you know, I said, "Leave me alone, now.
         You go on, now," because I was scared, you know, to bother anybody because I know I'd get a beating if I did!
         And, uh, she kept on, she kept on after me, and all of them was around there, you know, just, the children was terrible then, you know!
         But they was doing that just wanting to see, you know, just wanting to see a fight or something.
         And Josephine, she kept on.
         Josephine was a little old, real bright little old gal and she was
      she was, so she kept on.
         She come at me, she go, "Go at the little gully here when we leave the school, right here."
         Right here was a little gully.
         Right here was a little patch to get out in the big path you know, to go home.
         And so she kept on!
         She coming after me and I turned around and I take her and I just grabbed her and I clawed her face all up!
         Just clawed her to death!
      
      
         
            JBM: Bet,
      bet all of them, "Whoa!
         You're going to get it yet!"
         "Y'all," I say, "All of you leave me alone!"
         Because I knowed I was going to get a beating!
      
      
         
            JBM:
      I went home and, of course I, it was there before I got there, you know.
         
         Yeah, honey!
         Lord help me!
         It take a good while.
         I don't know what they kept, what they did about her face, but anyway I know it take a good long while to get her face like, yeah, child!
         I clawed her to death!
         I bet she didn't look at me no more!
         
            JBM: Didn't none of them, didn't none of them bother me no more!
      
      
         Huh-uh!
         JBM: Honey if, if you had get me mad, honey, I'd do you, I'd, ooh!
         The strength would come to me, you know, and I got mad, honey!
         But honey, when I got home I knowed, I dread to go home, because I knowed I was going to get it!
         
         JBM: Ooh!
         She could beat so!
         Ooh, honey!

         Honey, and you're going to know it, too!
         Ooh!
         And sometime Uncle Charlie, in the evening I'd be glad, you know, when Uncle Charlie come home from work and we'd be sitting and she'd say that she going to beat me.
         Well she beat, me and he say, "Winnie now that's enough now, Winnie!"
         And he'd get over me-
      
      
         
            JBM: -and she, she'd just beat him then, too-
      
      
         
            JBM: -until she got through.
         Honey, he'd take a, take a lot of beatings!
         O Lord!
         I thought he was the best daddy I ever had!
         
            JBM: I just loved him to death and I hated her!
         
         I thought, "She the meanest old thing I ever-."
         Oh!
         I thought she was so mean, you know,
      `cause she, `cause she beat me, see.
         I didn't know after while I'd appreciate it, you know.
      
      
         Uh-huh.JBM: But honey, I thought she mean thing.
         And one evening, I come from school.
         Well, I had dresses because the white people would always give me clothes.
         And so she said, ah, "Go in there and get that."
         She had a little, it was a little old straight dress.
         "You wash that dress now, because that the dress you going to wear tomorrow."
         And I wondered why I had to wear that dress.
         But honey, I went in there because there was water in that place.
         We had, we had big wash pans then, you know, had big old, like kettles like where you heated your water in.
         Well I went in there, I got that dress out, washed it out, and I rinsed everything out and went and hung it on the line.
         I can see it hanging now!
         
         Honey ( ), and, you know, directly she went out there, I went in the house, she went out the door, out right then and I went to the window and looked see where she going.
         She went out there, she went out there, she getting the dress pulling them seams open; pulling at it, you know.
         I got that thing, oh my, oh my, my, that thing hurt, you know.
         Honey, she was going there in them seams now looking and all.
         I said, "What is she-?"
         "Sister!"
         
         that's the way she called me, oh my Lord!
         I said, "What's so wrong?"
         "Ma'am?"
         
         I went out there, get the dress down, and take it and wash it.
         Honey, I had to wash that dress four times-
      JBM: -before,
      before I ever got to wear it.
         I said, "If I live and get grown, I'm going to carry all of my clothes to the laundry!
         I ain't going to-," saying it to myself because you'd better not say nothing and let them hear you!
         My Lord!
         They'd kill you then!
         
         Honey, I tell you the truth, yeah!
         And I got a whipping every time, you know!
         Oh Lord!
         Did I like laundry?
         No!
         I didn't want to learn no-
      , I didn't want to learn nothing about no laundry work!
         Not from that dress!
         
            JBM: Good gracious alive!
         Huh-uh!
         Oh Lord!
         All them, all they could go around there just so pretty, they might come out.
         But me?
         No!
         No, don't give me nothing
      to wash it out!
         After I got grown, the only thing I liked to, to iron was little baby clothes and hancherkefs Nothing else, no, no, no!
         One time we lived down in Brooklyn and Miss Sara and she taking care and she did laundry for these millionaires out there on, uh, I can't call the place now, but anyway and she'd come then she'd get Aunt Winnie and several people to help her, you know, do the washing and ironing.
         And one day then, I, I think we didn't have to go to school or something, but I went down and, Miss Wheeler was her name, she said, "Don't you want to iron a shirt?"
         "Oh yeah, but you-," I said, "I can't iron."
         "Well, you try to iron."
         Put me in there on an ironing board.
         And every time I'd iron there, then there'd be a wrinkle here and every time I iron there, I said, I said "I don't want to go down to Miss Wheeler's
      no more!"
         I wouldn't go down there no more either.
         I couldn't iron no white shirts or nothing else `cause I hated it!
         
            JBM: Ooh laundry, I hated it!
         I was so mad but you better not act like you're mad!
         Huh-uh!
         Don't you act like you're mad because honey, you're going to get it!
         "Yes ma'am, yes ma'am, ( ) yes ma'am!"
         Ooh my children!
         Lord, honey!
         And then they're in everything you do, "Who did so and so?"
         "Sister," he'd call me, "Sister did that!"
         
         He'd call me Sister, I'd say, "Babe!
         I didn't!"
         " Yes you did, too!"
         Well I'd be the one to get the whipping.
         Lord, I got so many whippings!
         Oh, it was awful!
         And, you know, then, they had, uh, wooden floors and you had to get down on your knees and scrub them.
         And honey, get down, and in them cracks!
         You'd better not leave not nothing in them cracks!
         Ooh Lord!
         On Saturday, that's when you had to scrub them floors!
         And Babe, he'd, he would get mad, you see.
         He'd put everything on me!
         He was supposed to be helping me and then he'd make me do it, you know!
         Oh, when it was awful!
         I said, I'd tell anybody, I'd say, "Please,"
      "don't let none of the children be home ( ), because it, you do so sure going to catch it!"
         
         Oh me!
         I'll tell you, I had it rough!
         Talking about it,
      , talking about it, ooh, my Lord!
         I said, "Um, um, um!"
         Ooh honey, I hated it a whole lot!
         I still hate laundry!
      
      
         
            JBM: I, I, do.
         
         ( )After, after that, he had a caf� and he'd, most all the time he'd send these shirts, you know, to the laundry.
         Well then one day up there, he wanted me to wash the tie, I mean, you know, wash the things what you use in the kitchen and then he give me two white shirts to carry over, over to the washerette with, right across the street then, right across ( ).
         And I came over and he said, he said, "Now you got to put bleach in there in the towels to get them clean," he told me.
         I said, "All right."
         So I put the towels, shirts, and everything together, poured bleach all over them!
         
         I didn't know
      about using bleach, pouring bleach!
         When his shirts come out, they come with little holes-
      JBM: -all over!
         All over!
         
         He didn't ask me to wash no more shirts!
      
         
         JBM: They, uh uh!
         He sure didn't ask me
      to wash no more shirts!
         Little holes, honey, all-!
         "I thought you knowed how!"
         I didn't know how, didn't want to know how
      so I-
      
   

   
   
      
         Let me start off by asking what is your full name and is there any story behind your name?
      
      
         My full name is Julia Kate Morris and there's really no story of any importance or interest.
         I was named after my grandmother Katie Sharp.
      
      
         OK.
         Do people in your family normally name children after family members?
      
      
         Oh yeah, it's a big deal in our family we've got more Catherines and Margarets running around than I can count.
      
      
         That is interesting.
         Well, my second question leading into the whole reason for the interview today, is childhood stories, and what is the first story that you remember from your childhood?
      
      
         I think the first story I remember, is um, Rapunzle.
         
         you know, "Rapunzle, Rapunzle let down your gold hair."
      
      
         Hum.
         Why?
         Did you like that story?
      
      
         I guess.
      
      
         Do you remember who told you the story?
      
      
         My mother
         .
      
      
         Was that your favorite story?
      
      
         I think so, I heard it a lot and I think I maybe um, related to the princess.
         I think all little girls do, because we both have blond hair.
      
      
         OK.
         So you and your friends used to play-act out some of these stories?
      
      
         Oh sure, I think all kids play-act things they hear from their childhood.
         You know Cinderella, Sleeping Beauty, that kind of thing.
      
      
         So of all these stories, what do you think might have been your most favorite from your childhood?
      
      
         I guess Rapunzle.
         That's the one I heard the most.
      
      
         What part of the story did you like the most?
      
      
         I think when she'd let her hair down and the prince would climb up the tower, to the tower room.
      
      
         OK.
         What was it about that that you liked so much?
      
      
         
         I don't know, I just thought it was kind of neat.
      
      
         The fact that her hair could be that long or something?
      
      
         Oh yeah.
      
      
         What was your least favorite part of the story?
      
      
         I really don't think I had a least favorite part.
         I thought the whole story you know, was very interesting at that age in my childhood.
         The whole thing was just amazing to me.
      
      
         OK.
         Of all the stories you read as a child, do you think any of those childhood stories had an impact on your life?
      
      
         Not that I can really say, you know.
         As you get older you realize that they're fairy stories and not based in any real truth, but that they were happy times for you as a child.
         But I can't say that they made any real impact.
      
      
         At what age do, did you realize that they were more for the fun or mythology or--
      
      
         Oh I don't know, probably around
         seven, eight, nine, something like that.
      
      
         OK.
         Speaking of your reading habits, as you got older, as a teenager, what type of reading material, what type of stories did you read?
         You know how were they different?
      
      
         Oh, I don't know that they were so much different.
         I read the um, Nancy Drew books, and I read the Hardy Boy books and um, whatever was,
         Black Beauty things of that nature.
         You know whatever was popular with young teenagers and um, kids my age at that time.
         You have to remember, this was a long time ago
         .
      
      
         Reading into your young adult life, what type of reading materials did move into then?
         
         And why?
      
      
         Um, there was a series of books I read, as I got farther into my teenage years, and for the life of me I can't remember the name of the character, but it was um, a series of books about a young woman that was a nurse.
         And um, I think those made, must have made some lasting impression on me, because here I am today.
      
      
         And what's your profession now?
      
      
         I'm a nurse.
      
      
         So I, so, I guess in some small fashion you associated with some of the characters?
      
      
         I'm sure.
      
      
         Alright.
         Do you have a favorite author?
      
      
         Um, yes.
         His name is Frank Perreti.
      
      
         What types of stories does he write?
      
      
         Um, he's a Christian author and he writes very dramatic stories uh, concerning um, such issues as, the second coming, Satan being among us, and they're not, they're not so much preachy gospel type books as they are very good um, drama, you know, almost scary type stories, but they're very good.
      
      
         So what was it specifically that drew you to these particular books?
      
      
         Well to tell you the truth um, it was the fly page on one of the books that I read.
         It was the little synopsis on the back, on the inside cover that drew me to the book.
         And I had no idea that the gentleman was a Christian author when I bought the book.
         It just sounded very interesting and uh, I've become quite a fan of his.
      
      
         OK
         .
         What uh, does your family have any collection of books or anything like that?
         Childhood books that maybe they passed down through the generations, that maybe, that was read to you as a child or anything like that?
      
      
         Not myself specifically, but I know that we still have a copy of a um,
         book your mother had from childhood that we read to you as a little boy.
      
      
         What was that?
      
      
         101 Dalmatians.
      
      
         
         Let's see.
         Going back to the stories about the nurse.
         Would you say that story had an impact on your life, or do you think that was just coincidence?
      
      
         No, it probably, in the long run it probably did, because it made me think about the you know, the desire to do for other people.
         The interest and excitement I guess there is in the medical field.
         Working in hospitals, specifically emergency rooms, was always uh, a thrill for me.
         And um, I guess that kind of, those books kind of set me to thinking, as a younger person.
      
      
         Were any of your childhood stories somehow related to that, in any fashion?
      
      
         No, uh huh, they were the typical little golden book childhood stories.
      
      
         How many stories do you remember from your childhood?
         You know, what types of stories do you remember?
      
      
         
         Um, oh, books like, your typical childhood books, like Black Beauty.
         Golly let me think.
         Oh, The Grimm's' Fairy Tales, um
         books of that nature, Cinderella, Sleeping Beauty, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.
      
      
         Now you said earlier that your mother read some of these stories to you.
         Did you ever read any of these stories on your own time?
      
      
         Oh sure we had, we had, like I said the little golden books that came in sets, and other storybooks.
         Um
         , I remember reading them myself as a child, and certainly as I got older um, reading was important.
         It's still important to me now, because I have such um, a reality based profession that when I, that when I do read it's solely for the purpose uh, of escaping reality.
         I'll read, I'll read just about anything I can get my hands on, that does not have anything to do with the medical field.
         Which I can't say is particularly, that's not completely the case, because I have read several of the, several of the Patricia Cornwell novels and her main character um, is a pathologist named Kay Scarpetta.
         So, but that's not really the primary sense in her book.
         Hers are, of course, murder/mystery type novels.
         Um
         , I read, yes I admit it, I've read Louis L'Amour, uh, but mostly the Sackett novels, because that deals a lot with um, the part of the country that I was born and raised in.
         Um, and I enjoy reading novels about that, but as far as reality based reading material, I don't, the newspapers about as reality oriented as I get.
      
      
         So where were you born?
      
      
         Albuquerque, New Mexico.
      
      
         Do you think that particular area of the country had any influence on the types of things that maybe you read as a child or as a young adult?
      
      
         Um, probably starting in high school it did, because my high school English teacher um, is a published author and is very popular in that part of the country.
         And I've noticed in the past couple of years that they're starting to sell his novels out here too.
         And uh, which really thrills me to see that, because he's such a talented person.
      
      
         Do you remember what his name is?
      
      
         His name is Rudolpho Aniya.
      
      
         What types of stories did he write?
      
      
         His books, course you know they always say you should write, write about what you know.
         His books are centered in that part the country in New Mexico and specifically in the um, Hispanic culture.
         His first uh, book is called Bless Me Ultima, and it was about his grandmother.
         Uh, and the rest of his books are kind of, have kind of a mystical quality to them because there's a lot of mysticism in the uh, Catholic uh, religion in the Hispanic culture in New Mexico.
         And uh, they're quite interesting.
      
      
         Would you say that some of the stories that you read growing up were more geo, geographically based in that area?
         By authors, I mean.
         Um, having lived in that area, obviously having a strong Hispanic influence, were some of the stories integrated in that fashion?
      
      
         Oh uh, sure they were.
         You always heard stories about that part of the country, about the conquistadors coming into the southwest and a lot of the reading material and, and uh what not centered around the history of the area.
         Because there was so much of it.
         Um, books like Rudolpho Aniya's books, um, Tony Hillerman's books, even though they're basically fiction, delve a lot into Native American culture and history.
         And uh, that area the country especially the area they call the Four Corners area.
         Really brings a lot of that to the fore there.
         They do a lot to help promote the uh, culture of that area of the country.
      
      
         I say, going back to some of the childhood stories in specific.
         Did you ever hear any stories, you know, like children's stories, not necessarily even books, but uh, maybe stories that had sort of Hispanic nature to them?
         Or background?
         You know like a bedtime story or scary story or anything like that?
      
      
         Oh, sure they're your usual scary stories.
         I don't remember any, any childhood stories about, specifically about children, like, like Hispanic fairy tales.
         But I remember um, one story in particular about uh, it's pretty similar to the lady, the one they have in South Carolina.
         About the lady at the beach that lost her children and she walks, you know, the, the beaches at night.
         This is similar, it's about a woman who lost her children, they were killed, and she walks the banks of what we call out there "arollos", they're, they're runoff ditches for flood water, calling for her children.
         I think every culture has a similar story in it.
      
      
         All right.
      
   

   
   
      
         I was born Sara Ann Snyder in Vicksburg, Lou--.
         Mississippi, excuse me.
         The reason I said Louisiana is because that's where I lived all of my life.
         Everyone went to Vicksburg, Mississippi to have their babies at the Mercy Hospital because we had no facilities in Lake Providence, the most beautiful place on Earth, surrounded by um, lakes, Cyprus trees, good people, right on the banks of the Mississippi.
         And so when I was born my mom went over there and stayed 10 days in the hospital, with her tummy strapped afterwards because that's the way you did it back in the 30's to assure yourself of a flat tummy when you got home.
         Um, I grew up in a very um, warm, loving, together, traditional family.
         Um, good manners were extremely important, my father would send us from the table if we laughed.
         We all had special places at the dinner table and I, being the oldest of four, sat at the end opposite my father.
         My mother sat to his left and he served the meat and she served the potatoes or rice and the vegetables and the food was passed around to everybody.
         And at the end of dinner I would get to serve the dessert.
         But, if I would spill a glass of milk, which I often did, then I was sent from the table, but I would often be tickled.
         My father was extremely um, uh
         firm but fair, totally unemotional and maybe you might be surprised to hear that because I am extremely emotional.
         And my mother, on the other hand, was a, "Darling this, darling that, I love you."
         Constantly.
         Constantly we were told how much we were loved and maybe that made a great,
         um, that was a great influence to me but, on the other hand, my dad um,
         kept a level of, of intensity, a level of, of uh,
         of wanting to do the right thing always, um, especially to please everybody.
         Um, he died when I was 21 years old of a heart attack.
         It was a congenital heart condition and I've often thought that he would still be in my presence today had we had the medical advances then as we do now.
         When I married my husband, soon after, well five months after he died, I cried every night and didn't realize how much his presence was in my life until he was actually gone.
         My mother was a beautiful woman.
         Very, very spoiled.
         Always wanted her way about everything and she was courted by men of all ages after my dad died.
         She remarried, much to my dislike.
         I don't think my younger sisters mind so much of the time, they were young, they were still in high school, uh, but my stepfather was a very nice man but he was 10 years older than my mom.
         He was a party man and he had sort of a florid face and I, it made me a little suspicious.
         But it turned out that they were married actually longer than my mom and dad.
         And I really began, and continued to, love him very much.
         And his name was Don.
         Um, my brother and I were two years apart and I loved him but not until we were 13, I think 13 and 11, we were typically quarreling siblings
         .
         We went to Florida on a family vacation one summer.
         The only vacation, by the way, that my daddy ended up taking us because all the way from Louisiana to
         Miami, Florida was almost too much for six people in a car to be together for a 10-day period.
         But coming home we stopped in New Orleans and my dad had been on a roller coaster in San Francisco and he thought it was such fun and so we went to Pontchartrain Beach in New Orleans and that was nearing the end of the vacation and he said he wanted my brother Fred and me to go for the experience, he thought it was going to be so much fun.
         So we were all excited about it and got on.
         My two younger sisters did not, they were three and seven at the time so they were not made to do this.
         And so we got on and, as we climbed the first little hill, it just looked wonderful; we could look out over the, over the beach and wave to Mom and Dad and Gay and Annette, my sisters.
         And then we got to the top and my brother and I were at either end of the seat, we still were not too fond of being, of sitting together so we got up and then suddenly, in our lives began to flash in front of us we were going so fast.
         Faster than the speed of sound I know.
         And I looked at Fred and he looked at me and the only thing I could say, "Dear God, if you will let me off of this thing, then I will never ever again fuss with my brother."
         And so, with ashen faces, we finally got back and I have never yet, by the way, been on another roller coaster.
         That was many years ago.
         And my brother and I, from that day, curiously, became very close.
         I don't know if it was a pact we both made.
         I have no idea what he prayed for.
         But, um, anyway, that was an um, early remembrance of family relationships.
         I was extremely close to my sisters because I was 10 years older than the baby and I virtually called her my own.
         I helped rear her because my mother played bridge.
         Every, it seemed like every day, but every other day and she would have her lady friends and I would have to go in and tend to the babies and make sure that they were dry or had their pacifier or their bottle.
         And, then, my sister Gay was seven years younger and I felt the same way about her.
         And we've remained close all through these years, we're extremely close family.
         We connect, we talk.
         Every little family happening we get on the phone.
         Everybody has to know all of it, whether it's good or bad and sometimes it is bad, or naughty.
         Um, where was I?
         I was talking about my sisters.
         There are just so many things that I remember of my childhood.
         Lake Providence was a town of about 5000 people.
         And it was um, lined with wonderful little um, hometown, small town stores.
         My grandfather had a hardware stare and we all worked there.
         My father was a graduate of LSU and majored in Physics and he opened a radio shop in the back of the store.
         And I used to work there and I, the most fond memory was that I had my own special number on the cash register, which was a great big piece of equipment in the middle of the store.
         And it's really strange but I still dream about that hardware store.
         I love to um, weigh nails.
         If somebody wanted to come in and, and purchase some type of hardware then I would get the nails, put them in a sack, and weigh them.
         Then I would go to the cash register and punch my number in and hand ring the cash register.
         That was really exciting.
      
   

   
   
      
         OK, um, say your name and where you were born and then just tell a story.
      
      
         OK.
         Name?
      
      
         Yeah, not the whole name, just first and last.
         No big deal.
      
      
         All right, my name is Sarah Murphy and I was born in Charlotte, NC, and my story is um, that my family has had a lake house for a very, very long time and, um, I've always been told that my great-grandfather and all of us, we have a tradition that usually every July 4th we go up there and we set off firecrackers and just kind of watch the neighbors and see their firecrackers.
         And we just take a boat ride and do a cookout and all this.
         So I've always been told that my great-grandfather, whom I've never met, one time was up at the lake and they were doing their traditional July 4th deal, um, and they were setting off the firecrackers and he accidentally just, I guess, got some messed up firecrackers, or set them off too soon, or what not, but he was right there and they kind of blew his fingers off.
         So that was really, and I've always been told that, and like I said, I've never met him or anything, but I was just kind of surprised that that happened and it taught me, I guess, to never go near firecrackers.
         I don't go within ten feet of them.
         So that's my story I guess.
      
      
         Good.
         OK.
      
   

   
   
      
         Ready?
         OK.
         This is Dorian.
         And your last name is--?
      
      
         Myles.
      
      
         Myles.
         OK.
         And she's 17 years old.
         Where were you born?
      
      
         I was born in Indianapolis, Indiana.
      
      
         Uh-huh.
         When did you move to NC?
      
      
         When I was
         two or three.
      
      
         Do you remember how old you were when you learned to read?
      
      
         When I learned to read?
      
      
         Uh-huh.
      
      
         I was probably four.
      
      
         Was it before you started to school?
      
      
         Yes.
      
      
         Uh-huh.
         So I imagine you enjoyed reading if you were already and you were four and not in school.
         Do you remember the kind of books you liked looking at and reading when you were
         little?
      
      
         Dr. Seuss!
         Dr. Seuss.
      
      
         Dr. Seuss?
         Did you like them to be read to you or did you like--.
      
      
         At first.
      
      
         Uh-huh.
      
      
         And, um, she read them so much that, until I memorized them.
      
      
         So you would play reading?
      
      
         Yeah.
      
      
         Did you go to the library?
         Did they take you to the library?
      
      
         Yeah.
         Maybe.
         Not that I really remember.
      
      
         Did you have a favorite Dr. Seuss?
      
      
         The Cat in the Hat.
      
      
         I bet you could say it!
      
      
         I can't remember it now.
         
      
      
         OK.
         The kinds of books that you liked to read yourself, were they different from the ones that people would read to you?
      
      
         Not really, because I pretty much chose the book, and they would read it.
      
      
         And they would read it?
         OK.
         Do you have little brothers or sisters?
      
      
         No, no.
      
      
         Nephews or nieces?
      
      
         No.
      
      
         Little kids around you at all?
         No?
      
      
         Occasionally.
      
      
         Did you ever read to them?
      
      
         I did.
         I have.
      
      
         Uh-huh.
         Do you remember anybody in your family that would tell stories without using a book?
         A grandparent or aunt or uncle?
      
      
         Not--.
         No.
         Not that I can remember.
      
      
         So you couldn't remember the story, if you don't have a story to tell.
         Well, that's pretty much what I needed to ask you about.
         I appreciate your helping us out with this.
      
   

   
   
      
         I would say between the ages of 7 to 10 years old it, was a really big thing to go to the movie on Saturday mornings.
         And one particular movie theater we went to, they would show serials every Saturday, which were a continued story.
         So if you missed one Saturday you would miss what happened in a particular episode and you, um, wouldn't know what had taken place.
         So we would go every Saturday morning.
         And also at this theater, they gave prizes to different people.
         And one of the way they gave prizes was, they would take big group photos and everybody, and there were stairs going up to a balcony, real wide stairs.
         And the big group of people would go stand on the stairs and there would be probably 30 or 40 kids in the picture.
         And they'd take the picture and then you would go back the next Saturday after they had been developed and they would have circled 3 or 4 people in the picture and the people whose head was circled would get the prizes.
      
      
         Is that for real?
      
      
         That's for real!
         That really happened!
         And one time I can remember, I think it was Steve, my brother, um, he, and they would give treats like candy, I don't even remember what all kinds of prizes the would give.
         But for some reason, and I think this is really true, he got ice cream sandwiches!
         Like a box of ice cream sandwiches.
         And of course there's nothing to do with a box of ice cream sandwiches when you're at a 2-hour movie!
      
      
         
            
         
      
      
         They're going to melt!
         And another, um, that was in, that was in High Point, NC.
         And then we moved to Charlotte and we used to go to � and I don't think its even still there I don't know if the building is or not � but the Dilworth Theatre.
         I lived in the Dilworth area, and we would go to the Dilworth Theatre and I do remember that it cost 9 cents to get a ticket to get in.
         And we would, could go to the movie.
         We would get maybe 15 cents each to go to the movie, and I sound like I'm 95 years old-
      
      
         
            
         
      
      
         -with those kinds of prices.
         Um, but we would go to the movie and then you would go in and get your, your snack that you wanted.
         And there were several different choices.
         I don't ever remember getting popcorn at the movie until I was a teenager or in my adult life.
         But we would, uh, buy, lollipops is what they call them now, but we called them suckers and we would get often a 2-cent sucker.
      
      
         
            
         
      
      
         Are you making fun?
      
      
         No, I love this story.
      
      
         And the 2-cent suckers is what is referred to now as a Tootsie Roll Pop.
         And we called them 2-cent suckers because every other sucker cost a penny.
         Except these were 2 cents because they had the Tootsie Roll in the middle.
         And there was one other sucker that cost a nickel and we called that an all day sucker, just because you couldn't eat the whole thing for the entire movie and you would really just have that sucker all day long.
         And one other form of refreshment that we got, which really embarrassed my mother because she didn't know anything about this until she went with us to the movie one Saturday, there was a bakery next door to the movie theatre.
         And my brothers and myself were not the only people that did this; all the kids that would go to the movie knew to do this.
         We would go into the bakery and we would ask for-
      
      
         
            
         
      
      
         -a nickel worth of scraps!
         
         
      
      
         And we didn't even have to ask for it because the bakery lady knew us and she knew to have all this ready for all the kids going to the movie.
         And what it was it was broken cookies and broken pieces of whatever happened while they were baking, mistakes.
         So they would fill little bags for us and we would give them a nickel and we could take that to the movie theatre with us.
         And that's all the stories I can remember about the movies right now.
         I do know that I did used to go the movie downtown at the Carolina Theatre.
         And when I was young, it wasn't a strange thing for the kids to just go off and go to a movie.
         I mean, my mother knew where we were going and she knew when we would get back, but today you wouldn't send your seven or eight year old child to a movie theatre alone even if they were with their nine year old brother; you just wouldn't do it.
         And we could skate to the movie or ride a bicycle to the movie and we would do that.
         Which is kind of sad that you can't do that anymore and it's not just because things are, there're bad people in the world but it's too much traffic.
         You have to check everything about a movie, check it out to see what the content is and just wasn't like that when I was growing up
         .
         Also about that same time period in my life, I guess again between seven and ten years old, which seems to be what I remember most vividly, my best friend uh, was Kathy Josey, and she was a next door neighbor also, and we remained friends up until, uh, she was about 35 and she passed away with cancer.
         But we, we remained close friends.
         In fact we shared an apartment, first apartment either one of us ever had.
         And when we were, um, little girls we used to play "Career Girls"!
         
         We did!
         And we used to try to dress up and pretend we were businesswomen.
         And we would go to work and pretend we had an apartment together and then when we grew up, we sure did; we got an apartment.
      
      
         Uh-huh.
      
      
         Um, Kathy and I also used to play other kind of dress ups and it just, it seems like, I remember we both had like our mother's long skirts, or the skirts would be long on us and we would literally wear dress up clothes that belonged to our mothers.
         But we had, Kathy had one pair of pearls or beads of some sort of necklace that was her mother's and I didn't have the necklace.
         And it was really beautiful and I really, really wanted one.
         So we only had the one necklace and we, er, we decided, I don't know if it was jointly or if Kathy was just extremely nice of whatever, but she said I could wear it part of the time.
         And we would literally time the amount of time, we wore it like 30 minutes or 15 minutes or whatever.
         And the way we decided who got to wear it first, and this always kind of bothered me because I know Kathy did this intentionally, she said the youngest one got to wear it first and she was like six months younger than I am.
         So, it, that became
         a normal thing with us.
         Whenever we only had one of something she would always say, "Well, I think the youngest one gets to do it, or wear it or whatever first."
         And, that just always stuck in my mind, that in, in our adult life I brought that up to her and she sort of acted like she didn't know anything about that and I thought to myself, "she does," and then she laughed about it and she realized that she had kinda held a trump card on that one.
         Um, also we did a lot of pretending and as I said we played career girls and the dress ups.
         And my sister and I used to pretend also and Jill is about 2 years younger than I am, maybe two and a half, and we used to play Robin Hood except we didn't have a Maid Marion, we had a Saretha, I don't know where in the world that name came from.
         But we would switch playing Robin Hood, one would play Robin Hood and one would play Saretha.
         And Saretha was the counter, would be the same thing as Maid Marion, and, why, again, I don't know why we didn't use Maid Marion.
         But in my mind I can remember playing that, like all day long.
         And we would go over to my grandparents' and they had a a big white house with a big front porch and, uh, banisters on it and a lot of rocking chairs out on the front porch.
         And it was just a great place to pretend and we would climb up on the porch and on the banisters and we could make those our horses or, uh, it could be a castle; just do many things with it.
         Um, and when we were still living in High Point in our back yard we had a huge, I don't know, I guess it was an oak tree, but it was a really big tree, but it was a climbable tree.
         And it had real large, thick branches extending out to the side and they were fat enough branches where as a child of eight and nine years old we could straddle the branches.
         And that was another game that Jill and I used to play; we would pretend we were in the jungle and we would climb up on the tree and we would straddle the tree branches and pretend it was our elephant.
         And in the yard, we had an old tree that had been cut down and just the stump was remaining and my mother had planted, um, flowers all around that stump and we would use that stump as a, as a throne and the princess got to sit up on that stump on that throne and have all those flowers around her and that would be the throne and she would be the queen or the princess or whatever.
         When I was a teenager, an Audrey Hepburn movie came out called Wait Until Dark.
         And I think I was probably 16 or 17 years old; we were of driving age.
         And I had a group of girlfriends that I ran around with and there were, golly, there might've been 8 to 10 of us who were good friends.
         Everybody had their own "best" friend but then we had one big group that we used to do a lot of things together.
         Um, and we would, had that many girls but we would only go out in a couple of cars and I remember one of the girls, Betty Belle, her dad had a VW Beetle, and we'd fit like 5 girls in that VW Beetle.
      
      
         Did Betty Belle turn Catholic?
      
      
         No, huh-uh.
      
      
         She didn't?
      
      
         No.
         So we went out one night to the movie, but before we went to the movie we went to get pizza and then we went to, and I think the name of the place was The Open Kitchen, and we didn't have chain pizza places like we do now, like Pizza Hut and all that.
         This was just a really neat pizza place that all the kids would go.
         And we went to Open Kitchen and we would have eight or 10 girls and we would order one pizza and all share it and everyone would only get one piece and I think we would make the waitresses mad because we didn't have money to leave tips.
         We would also drink water.
         So it wasn't a good situation for the waitresses, but we had fun and we didn't even think about it.
         We just did what we could get away with.
         Anyway, that night we were gonna go see Wait Until Dark and I think it was on at the Manor Theatre, and I just remember when you have like 10 or so girls going somewhere to the same place it's kind of a, pretty much of a spectacle; we're all in this long line and we're giggling and laughing and cutting up and having really a great time.
         So we bought our tickets and we went into the Manor Theatre and we found a row of seats and we sat, file, all filed in.
         And I just remember seeing, and I was sitting in a middle section, I was not on an end so I had girls I knew on both sides of me.
         And I just remember that movie was, had a lot of hype about being really scary and suspenseful and it's nothing like these movies that are out today like Scream and, what is it?
         Nightmare on Elm Street whatever it is, where they're actual horror movies.
         This was, uh, a real intense, um, drama and, just very scary; kept you on the edge of your seat.
         And there was a scene in the movie I remember where every one of us, and it wasn't just our group, but so many people in the theatre, they screamed out at one time.
         And that's really all I remember about that night, it was just a lot of fun.
         And I really hope that my daughters have had some nights like that and has had good times like that, that I can remember going out with good friends.
      
   

   
   
      
         I'm supposed to give like an introduction like ( ).
      
      
         ( ) say your name, how old you are, where you're from.
      
      
         My name is Frank Nesbitt.
         
         I'm from Newburg, NY, living in Charlotte, been here for four and a half years.
      
      
         Oh didn't ( ).
      
      
         
         It's all right, you know, but, um, I got a cold right now, so I sound kind of funny, know what I'm saying, though, um, I got a story for you.
         When we first came, me, me and my fianc�, when we first came to, um, Charlotte, we had got a job at, um, at, uh, Boston Market, making five dollars and 75 cent a hour.
         Um, we got the job through her mother's boyfriend, his sister, you know what I'm saying, was the manager there, so she hooked us up well.
         At the time, we thought she hooked us up.
         It was crazy.
         Anyway, the damn boss, the general manager name was, um, Dean Little, blond, blond-haired, older dude like, you know, late forties, I mean early forties.
         And, um, we was working there for like a few weeks, and, um, he was talking about getting himself a new car, getting himself a new Maxima.
         He had a old Maxima, like a, like a `90, like a `90.
         He was talking about he was getting like a `96 it was '97 at the time, so he, you know, I'm going to get rid of my car, and I'm like, all right, talking about the old Maxima, I said,
         "I could use, we need a car," know what I'm saying, me and my girl need a car.
         He said, "Yeah," you know, all enthusiastic and shit, like really, this the general manager, mind you, he was like, "Hey you got," you know, "You been working for me," you know, "Been a, been a great worker," you know, "A nice guy.
         I like you," you know.
         "You and your fianc�e and um, I'll, I'll sell you the car for five hundred dollars."
         Scratch that.
         He'll give it to me for a hundred.
         That how crazy lost, no doubt we'll do that.
         Let's do that.
         The day he set it up, he was supposed to do it, he drove his wife's car.
         He said, um, his wife wanted to hold on to it for a little bit longer.
         "Until we," you know, "Pick up the new Maxima."
         So two weeks go by.
         We ask him about the car again.
         The price went up to five hundred dollars.
         But he'll definitely give it to us, you know what I'm saying, it's no problem.
         I said, "All right, cool."
         He said this driving us on the way home one night.
         This is how, this is how we interacting, so I'm thinking everything is cool, you know, funny dude at the job, you know, get along with him real easy-going compared to the assistant, uh, manager that was there, you know what I'm saying.
         He, um, he'll drive us home, if we need to pick us up from the bus station if, you know what I'm saying, if we need him to.
         Now he going to sell me this Maxima that I know is good because he drive it everyday except the day he supposed to sell it to us for five hundred dollars.
         He a good man.
         I said, "Yeah, we can do that.
         You can take us to the ATM right now.
         We'll get the five, we'll get the money for you right now, and we'll give it to you."
         Threw him off, you know what I'm saying.
         Like I said, we making five seventy-five, we brand new to Charlotte.
         He knows this you know, he know the whole situation, so I think we kind of, kind of threw him off.
         We was able, you know, to produce that kind, that amount of money right on the spot.
         So immediately, uh, you know, "Uh, not tonight," you know, "Tuesday, Tuesday we'll do it."
         "All right, whatever.
         That's cool."
         Tuesday come by, he don't drive the car.
         He don't drive the car, wife got it.
         This go on for about a week.
         Next thing I know, we in this little, like it's, like this little park, it's not even a parking center, it's like a driveway, and it's got to Boston Market and a uh, uh, beauty salon on the side of it, and some other thing, I think maybe, I don't know, you know what I'm saying.
         They share the same parking lot.
         Little, small, and, um, they got this beautician over there.
         Dude
         , Dean's wife, drove the Maxima to the job that, that we was supposed to been buying, and, uh, she didn't know me.
         She probably only knew me by name, you know what I'm saying?
         She comes in into the, uh, to the Boston Market and ask me do I know where the dude, uh, the beautician is, do I know where he at, you know, is he in, something to the effect.
         I ( ) said, "No."
         "Because," she said, "I'm trying," uh, "I have the title to his car and I'm trying to give it to him."
         She didn't know, she didn't know that, you know.
         So she goes to have a seat in Boston, inside the restaurant.
         She goes and have a seat.
         Two minutes later the beautician comes, walks in, you know what I'm saying, walks in sit down with her at the table.
         They talk or whatever, whatever, whatever she gives him the title to the car.
         The car that we was supposed to have been buying, that Dean said he going to sell to us for five hundred dollars, knowing the situation, knowing that we need a, you know, car, knowing the situation, I thought, you know, this a real dude here.
      
      
         Never told--
      
      
         Came through, coming through, you know big up Dean, but that's when I seen how, how dirty Caro, Carolinians are.
         They some dirty motherfuckers.
         
         That's my word.
         I mean I never been around on, on, I never been around people that are, are, that are conniving at this level.
         I mean they, it's dirty.
         I they're dirty.
         All scales, women, females, men, old, young, black, white, fat, tall, short, cute, ugly, all that.
         Dirty!
         Dirty people, you know what I'm saying?
         I done been around here four and a half years working a lot a different places and shit, but came in contact with a lot of different people from a lot of different sides of the, you know what I'm saying, of the spectrum.
         That's why I know that this little, that right there is void, you know, it should be.
         Revised at least at the bare minimum because I done dealt with people and you can't, can't put them in, you can't box them!
         You can't, we're individuals.
         And they always sit there and try to say because they want to make a link or make a point, and then they want to box us.
         Other than that, we're individuals, you know.
         Everybody is everybody.
         That's what makes us special.
         There's only one of, you know what I'm saying--
      
      
         Not really.
      
      
         Now, but you hear what I, I'm saying though.
      
      
         I understand what you're saying.
      
      
         But anyway that was my story, you know what I'm saying, and it was just, it was just crazy.
         But that was our first lesson, you know what I'm saying, to let us know we wasn't home, you know, wasn't home anymore.
         We got to bite the bullet.
         We don't have no, uh, no, no, uh, refuge.
         This is it, know what I'm saying?
         We jumped in, both hands and feet, jumped in you know what I'm saying?
         We here.
         Four years, four and a half years later we got a accounting degree, you know what I'm saying, two vehicles, you know what I'm saying, all later models than that, that, you know what I'm saying, uh, uh than the Maxima was, so fuck Dean,
         you know what I'm saying?
         I'm serious, you know, so, but it let us, you know, where we at I dealt with shit like that to the present day, you know what I'm saying, from different people, different sides of the spectrum.
         People that, when I came in, I guess, I had them boxed and they let me know that they not contained, they just a wild unit, you know what I'm saying?
         That's why, you know, that's why I said what I said about that.
         That's it.
         I forgot another thing.
         Since I'm talking about it, I'm going to get it off my chest too.
         I got to get it off completely though.
         After, after that, you know what I'm saying, after I witnessed that that happened, you know what I'm saying, after I witnessed what had happened, I sit up there and confronted, you know, I didn't confront, well I did.
         I kind of confronted him like, you know, "What's up with the car?"
         You know what I'm saying?
         The man still didn't know that I seen the transaction then.
         He didn't know that his wife came to me.
         I just so happened to be the worker she actually talk to, you know what I'm saying?
         Told me what she was there for, you know what I'm saying?
         He trying to act like he still got the car, they still got the car here, you know.
         They still waiting for this, that, and the third, and his wife, so after that, I just wasn't feeling him no more, you know.
         I, I, I hated him, you know what I'm saying?
         I like, I mean because he just, he smack, then I felt like he, you know what I'm saying, like he violated, you know.
         So he just, and then I had to work underneath of him.
         Then he was smug about it, trying to lie about it, trying to act like, you know, nothing happened, you know, anyway two, what two days later, he, he fired me.
         Yeah, talking about he don't like my attitude because when I come in now, I don't smile at him, you know what I'm saying, I don't carry on a conversation with him.
         I just go on and do my job, do a good job, and, you know, and I go.
         That wasn't good enough for him.
         He too, came to the side, told me, you know, actually he pull me in the back, said, "Can I talk to you?"
         I said, "Sure."
         No he didn't.
         He sent that fat, what's that, what's the girl name?
         Rhonda Shasta, I hated her.
         Shasta the kind of female just thought that the sun rose when she opened her eyes.
         The sun rose, you know what I'm saying, bottom line, she was ugly.
         She was piggish.
         
         And I don't mean, I don't mean, I don't mean it as in her personality, I'm talking that, but including her, her physical.
         When you looked, you get kind of like a piggish
         , you get a piggish vibe from her, for real.
         And she, she was very animated, you know, very animated, real country, country.
         And she just thought that she was the shit.
         She was there first whatever, whatever.
         I'm supposed, I don't know, I'm supposed to tip tap,
         you know, I don't know, but, you know, but, I'm sure they assumed, when they seen a black guy, that's it.
         And they assumed, "OK, well he's this he's that."
         And they said, "Hold up, she's white!
         So that's a black guy with a white, so that changes everything now."
         So now they got to try to make a different analysis of, "OK, so he's like this and like that and she got to be like that," you know what I'm saying, and that's the way it is.
         And then we got to work in them, within them compounds.
         We got to work and we got to survive, know what I'm saying, like that's what I was saying before.
         People automatically want to make up these, these, you know, these groups but it's not true not for each and every one of us.
         And then the ones that those, uh, uh, particular things that, uh, uh, classify that group, soon as I get, know what I'm saying, uh, affected by it, or have to go through, I'm either caught off guard, or it hurts me, or shit, sometimes it could destroy people.
         I mean, because that's not me and I'm caught off, I wasn't expecting that, you know what I'm saying, but anyway he fired me, fired me.
         Because he didn't, I wasn't smiling and laughing and all that stuff like that.
         Told me he didn't like my attitude, didn't think my attitude, you know, he think it'd be best if uh, uh, uh, that's the first time I heard it's not working out, not working, can't stand that shit.
         That shit make you want to put a pin in they fucking eye, for real ( ).
      
      
         \\ All right now don't make me stop\\ this tape.
      
      
         \\ You know what I'm saying.
         \\ ( )
      
      
         Would you hurry up?
         
      
      
         No you want to hear the voice, this is for real, I'm 24 years old.
         I been dealing with this since I was 19 years old.
         Never, never in my wildest dreams.
         I don't know, it's crazy.
         It's crazy because all you ever heard of was "southern hospitality."
         That's all you ever heard up north.
         Classifying.
         We classified a whole South.
         We just said, "OK, this is how they are.
         They just, they love you to pieces," you know what I'm saying?
         Everything is laid back.
         They feed the hell out of you, you know what I'm saying?
         Everything is just, you know, the weather's beautiful, you know what I'm saying?
         You, on farms you see chicken or some kind of fucking animal or something, you know what I'm saying, that you can eat, you know what I'm saying, running around the house, or whatever.
         Dog stuff, like that, old grandma cooking everything early in the morning.
         But it wasn't like that.
         I come to realize when I came down, mind you, you got to think this is the last place that held on to slavery as long as they could possibly hold on to it.
         Just about, you know what I'm saying, you know what I'm saying?
         So you got to remember that that's still here that's here.
         It's the foundation, it's the essence, it's the essence.
         Right now they in the process of trying to, you know, perfect the masch, but I'm looking past the masch I'm looking at, at the entity or what have you, you know, classify.
         I'm looking at it like that, you know, it gave me all new meaning to, uh, uh, southern hospitality.
         Now I understand that.
         I, it's just crazy, it's crazy, it's crazy.
         That's why when I do go to school here, I'm going to go to school here for dirt cheap because I been living here since they robbed us with Angie and everything, so I'm going to go for cheap, hurt them, and then I'm, I'm gone.
         I'm leaving.
         I'm not going to put no money into the, into the community, I'm not going to put no money into the state, or anything.
         The city can just forget about it, I'm just gone.
         I don't want nothing to do with this no more.
         I'm tired of it.
         Shit, by that time it'd be, what eight years, nine years that's a long, that's a long time.
         That'd be enough, though.
         That's a chapter, that's a good chapter.
         It's interesting too, you'll read about it too, and be like, "Damn, that's all right," you know what I'm saying.
         But, um, that's it.
         I just wanted to tell you about how he sandbagged me.
         Cut me at the knees.
      
   

   
   
      
         Hi.
         My name is Chris O'Connor.
         And um, I'm a host-family, person for Hye-Jin.
         And I'm, I'm, um, I'm honored um, to participate in the project.
         Um, what I would like to do is explain to Hye-Jin an experience I had, um, as, as a young child, uh, something that um, has stayed to me really all of my life and is especially meaningful now that I live in the South.
         Because I was born in the North, I was raised in the North I, you know, truly am, um, I consider myself a northern American, um, and quite by surprise um, we came to live in Charlotte two and a half years ago, um, mainly for work reasons.
         Both my husband and I had lost our jobs in the North.
         So, we came south, because this is where the jobs are and fortunately, we were able to get work and re-located here.
         So, this is two and a half years later, and my husband and I are employed in the public schools in Charlotte.
         My husband is a teacher, and I'm a counselor.
         And um, we find ourselves in a very diverse school, which is all good uh, we find ourselves um, working with many many more uh, black or Afro-American people than we were ever exposed in the North.
         And that has um, made me remember um, that when I was in um, the second grade, I was seven years old.
         And I was um, growing up in the North in Wilmington, DE.
         And my father was transferred to Pensacola, FL.
         And we had never lived in the South before, except for one other brief, brief time I should say we had lived in Camden, SC um, where act, actually one of my brothers was born.
         But when I was seven, we moved to Pensacola, FL, and um, we, there were four children, and we were enrolled in a Catholic school, because my parents were Catholics, and um, they wanted us to go to the Catholic schools in the South.
         So, I went to, I was in the second grade, and I went to Sacred Heart School in Pensacola, FL.
         And I became friendly.
         Um, I made friends.
         And two of my very good girl friends when I was in second grade, their names were Patricia Callahan, and Linda Emanuel.
         And their families, their parents were southern born and bred.
         But um, in time we became very close friends, and then to our childhood friendships, our parents became good friends.
         So, most of our social life was spent visiting back and forth in each other's homes, and our parents would have dinner together and they would get together, and have parties, and they really had a wonderful time.
         And um, as time wore on and our families and our parents became better acquainted, I can imagine that my parents really being the only northern born and bred people began to see the differences in their attitudes, uh, in their racial attitudes as opposed to the attitudes of their friends and by that I mean um, my parents had been raised in the North, and there were never um, very many black people around.
         But they were never raised with any prejudice.
         I guess I can say they were Christian, they were Catholic um,
         I don't believe um, they really had any predisposition or any prejudice toward black people.
         And I think that when they moved to the South and they saw the prejudice of their good friends.
         I think it really uh, really bothered them to the point that they wanted to make sure that their own children did not grow up with those prejudices.
         And I can give you a good example.
         Now, it was very common, when I was seven years old and I was the oldest of the four children, um, my mother hired a black woman to help her once a week.
         The lady's name was Ira Lee, and she was a black lady.
         And she would come to our house once a week, and she would help my mother clean.
         She would do all kinds of household, um, activities, because my mother had four children, very close in age and I'm sure she was a big help.
         It was, it was just a very acceptable thing to do among middle class people.
         I don't think I really thought twice about it.
         So um, my mother learned of Ira Lee from her very close friend, my girl friend's mother.
         Um and we all went to the same school together and the same church together.
         And so that's how we found out about Ira Lee.
         And Ira Lee come to our house once a week, and then she would help my mother, and then at dinner time, I can remember we all sit at our dinner table uh, four McDonough children and my two parents and Ira Lee always sat at the table with us.
         I remember it very well and she was just part of our family.
         She was like our guest, she just ate dinner with us.
         But I'll never forget when we went to have a lunch at my girl friend, Patricia's house, where Ira Lee also worked.
         And Ira Lee fixed lunch for us.
         And it was my mother and me, and my friend Patricia and her mother, and my friend Patricia's two sisters and we all sat down at the dinner table together to have the lunch that Ira Lee fixed for us.
         But Ira Lee had to sit in the kitchen by herself.
         It was not considered appropriate, I guess it would be the word or it was not considered acceptable in that household to have a black woman sitting with, sitting at the same�� M � � *

         Hi.
         My name is Chris O'Connor.
         And um, I'm a host-family, person for Hye-Jin.
         And I'm, I'm, um, I'm honored um, to participate in the project.
         Um, what I would like to do is explain to Hye-Jin an experience I had, um, as, as a young child, uh, something that um, has stayed to me really all of my life and is especially meaningful now that I live in the South.
         Because I was born in the North, I was raised in the North I, you know, truly am, um, I consider myself a northern American, um, and quite by surprise um, we came to live in Charlotte two and a half years ago, um, mainly for work reasons.
         Both my husband and I had lost our jobs in the North.
         So, we came south, because this is where the jobs are and fortunately, we were able to get work and re-located here.
         So, this is two and a half years later, and my husband and I are employed in the public schools in Charlotte.
         My husband is a teacher, and I'm a coher about it later.
         And um, my mother I remember this is what I remember my mother's saying.
         This made such an impression on me.
         She said, "Well, don't you ever tell Mrs. Callahan that you slept in the same bed with Ira Lee.
         Mrs. Callahan would be shocked."
         So, I just, I just remember that very well and I never ever let this be known that it happened, although it didn't bother me, because I was very comfortable with Ira Lee.
         You know, I didn't even think twice about it.
         And I certainly don't think I was damaged by it at all.
         I just got the very strong message that was not something that should be repeated to this particular lady and the particular lady was a very fine person, a very good person, a very good mother, a very good Catholic, but she had been raised in the South.
         And that was totally, totally unacceptable to her way of thinking.
         So that's my um, recollection of um, Ira Lee, of um, growing up um, in the South, in the 50's probably.
         So, I just um, would like to share that story.
         I think we, I think we've come, hopefully, we've come a long way from, from that um, mode of thinking.
      
      
         So that maybe that kind of thinking has changed.
         Do you think maybe?
      
      
         Well, I think there has been, I mean, if you figured that was in the 50's.
         Oh, I know there have been a lot of good changes.
         I mean since Martin Luther King and all of that um, I still think, I still, I still know though that there is still prejudice.
         Uh, both ways, white people to black, towards black people, and black people towards white people and with all the races, it's not just limited to blacks and whites.
         That was just my own personal experience, but sometimes now not that I dwell on this, when I think of my present working situation were I work in a school really there are, the black children are, there are more blacks than whites are, it's pretty even but a little more black children.
         And you know, our faculty, we have a black woman principal whom I respect very much.
         I think she is a very fine person.
         And a lot of the black teachers, I think I respect them very much.
         I will say that I'm quite impressed with some of the black people.
         I notice um, black teachers, black people uh, I notice that at lunchtime when we sit down to have lunch they immediately stop and say a silent prayer immediately, that's just routine of them.
         And you know, I admire that very much.
         And it's really I see it more with the black people than I do with the white people.
         Um so, um yes, we've come a long, long way since when I was a little girl.
         But we still have a long way to go too.
      
   

   
   
      
         All right.
         I learned this story, you know, probably was about, I was about 12 years old, 12 or 11, somewhere around there, you know, elementary school, about the time when Mom let you walk home from school, or, you know what I'm saying, you have a little bit of freedom on your own, you know.
         So the story, uh, was told to me by some of the older guys in the neighborhood about somebody that it happened to when he was our age.
         It was during the summer, probably, let's see, yeah, it was 1986 `cause I played football that year, the summer of 1986.
         I remember `cause I wore number 86.
         And, uh, the story was about Mr. BHD, that's what we called him.
         And the reason why I got confused with the man in the black hat was because the man in the black hat was BHB.
         The BHB is the Butt Hole Bandit and you know what I'm saying, it all started from the time where, you know what I'm saying.
         And we'd be walking home from school and we'd see some man.
         I, I guess, you know what I'm saying, somebody wore a black hat just looked creepy that you'd never seen before.
         So we were just like, "There goes the man with black hat."
         Then come to find out that during that same summer, this guy that played on our football team had, supposedly was walking through the park, Briarwood Park on, um, Plaza.
         The same, uh, elementary school that we went to.
         He was walking home from the basketball court and he supposedly got raped by this dude.
         And, you know what I'm saying, it was real gross because they went into details about him having to have stitches and all this stuff by this dude raping him.
         He was supposedly this old man in a black hat and he walked around from neighborhood to neighborhood trying to follow kids.
         And so we started right then calling, so we started right then calling him The Butt Hole Bandit.
      
      
         
            
         
      
      
         So, you know what I'm saying, from then on, you know, for one: the dude that, uh, supposedly gotten raped had disappeared, you know what I'm saying, I mean he didn't disappear he had just like left town and so we really didn't know the truth.
         We really didn't know if it really did happen, we couldn't ask him.
         You know being kids, most likely we would have asked him, you know what I'm saying, but during that summer, he had disappeared.
         He and his family had left or something like that, so we just stayed up in the air whether it had happened or not.
         So all the older guys and everybody was just like, "Man, watch out for the guy with the black hat.
         Watch out the for the BHB, the Butt Hole Bandit."
         So any time we saw people walking down the street that look didn't look familiar, `cause we had a pretty close knit community, so we had people walking around the neighborhood or whatever, you know what I'm saying, that looked funny, everybody would be scared.
         Everybody'd go run in the house.
         And we were some bad kids, too!
         I'm talking about we was bad I'm talking about throwing rocks at buses and doing a lot of stupid stuff but when it came to the BHB-
      
      
         
            
         
      
      
         -for real!
         We watched out, you know.
         And we always played in the park, used to run around the park or whatever, but when it got dark nobody was out as far as by themselves, and if you was out you better be in shape `cause you're running.
         I can remember running from, it had to be at least a mile `cause I ran through the woods from Orr Road to my house.
         Orr Road, right over there like going to UNCC, to Hampshire Hill through the back way.
         I had to go through the little, sorry park in our neighborhood.
         And I remember running the whole way and I wasn't even, I wasn't in shape or nothing.
         But it was just for the fear of the Butt Hole Bandit.
         And, you know what I'm saying, so then on, you know what I'm saying, just like I said, you had people looking for the people with the black hat and then anybody that came in our neighborhood: we would just razz them.
         And I remember one time, we were picking on this dude who wanted to fight, you know what I'm saying, we thought we were the stuff `cause nobody could catch us on our bikes.
         This dude was walking through our neighborhood and we started calling him the Butt Hole Bandit and whatnot and he started chasing us and he was saying he was the Butt Hole Bandit-
      
      
         
            
         
      
      
         -but he probably just saying it,-
         
         
      
      
         -you know what I'm saying, to scare us even more.
         So you know what I'm saying, he, he really scared us-
      
      
         
            
         
      
      
         -and from then on, you know what I'm saying, as we got older we still like right, right when you know what I'm saying.
         I was, was asked to tell the story you know what I'm saying, I asked my boy and he had so many stories about the Butt Hole Bandit.
         He used to talk about how he's almost still scared of the Butt Hole Bandit cause nobody really knows, you know what I'm saying, what happened to the little kid who supposedly got raped.
         Well, you know, ain't nobody still seen him to this day but most likely probably, if that did happen to him, he's probably so embarrassed to come back around or whatever they probably moved away.
         But, I mean, you know, the Butt Hole Bandit story was, was one of the biggest ones and it was the man in the black hat.
         And you know kids, we was playing sports, always out at night being bad, so you know what I'm saying, so anytime the Butt Hole Bandit came up everybody got tense.
         Everybody was ready to go home.
         Everybody was ready to go in somebody's house stay in or whatnot.
         You used to purposely spend the night over to people's house cause you scared to walk home.
         And say if it was like, say eight houses down street either you were going to run or we were going to have our mom pick us up.
         So, you know what I'm saying, it was just really shook a whole bunch of us kids.
         I mean that and I mean it probably, probably didn't even happen at all.
         It's like one of them little urban legends of, of a man who went somewhere and did something bad and just really messed up the minds of all these kids but probably helped us; you know what I'm saying.
         We didn't need to be out at night anyway.
         But, uh, that's about it.
      
   

   
   
      
         My name is Jason Phillips.
         I'm 23.
         Been lived in Charlotte for 23 years.
         The story that I am going to tell is about my great, great, great granddaddy who was a bootlegger from Yanceyville, NC.
         Um, I think this story, well the story been told through my family because of, uh, what he had and what they tried to take from him.
         And he was a bootlegger and the sheriff and all the deputies, I guess, evidently he had the best moonshine in all of Yanceyville
      so, so the, uh, the sheriff, you know, was friends with them, you know, and use to get his liquor from him and the deputies and stuff.
         And he own a lot of land up there.
         Had a farm, chickens, cows, bulls, all that good stuff, lake on the property, and, um, a couple of the deputies was in the KKK, a couple of the deputies was in the KKK, and, um, and what, uh, else did they use to say?
         They said, I mean, he was the man, you know, they said back then you ain't see too many black guys with brand new trucks and stuff like that, but he had the new trucks and, ah, he also ran numbers too.
         They said that he ran numbers and, um, the deputies use to tell him, you know, to watch out, you know, some of the cooler ones that won't in the Klan.
         But the sheriff, you know, always said, you know, he told him when it was really time for him to get out he needed to get out.
         Evidently he got smart and got out but the story goes, you know.
         He was going on and on and on and he was mixed at that, you know, he was half white and black, but they ain't really didn't too much bother him about that because of the fact his daddy was black and his momma was white, you know.
         They had a problem with that but, um, um, he had a lot of money, from what I understand.
         He had a lot of money and then things got thick.
         A lot of them white people start getting jealous and start trying, you know, take the property and stuff doing little stuff, going out killing his chickens.
         They ain't mess with the his bulls or nothing.
         They use to come on, he use to charge people to come on his property and hunt deer, and they use to sneak on and stuff and he catch them out there but he couldn't shoot them because he know he'd get lynched if he did that.
         And then one day, um, somebody got jealous, came down, and burnt down the trailer, he had a trailer on the property, then came and burned down the trailer and burnt up the chicken coop, but eventually he got all that back.
         Kept on bootlegging and they still getting jealous and I remember going to, after getting all of that back, you know, back.
         It's still there now, but I remember, and I still do when we, when I go to the family reunions.
         We go out to the chicken coop and it stink.
         I don't go in there though, but I always go out to the, uh, where they got the cows and the bulls at, and check them out and go and get up on desk stand and see where they at.
         And, um, he even still got some of those old kettles back there they broke and all mess up and stuff, and his kettles were hidden inside the chicken coop.
         And, and, um, um, um, what am I trying to say?
         Oh.
         When it really got thick, when, um, it got to one point where him and sheriff fell out, and the sheriff, you know, he wasn't really, I guess, evidently, let them tell it, he was the cool guy.
         And the little Klan people, um, found out, you know, what the sheriff's men, or whatever, what was going on.
         And they were already jealous, a black man making money, or a half back man making money, or whatever you want to call it, and they came and burnt the house down, burnt the chicken coop down, and they killed a cow, or a couple of cows, I ain't too sure about that, but I think they killed a cow or a couple of cows.
         And, um, they tried to take his land from him and they took it from him for a minute, and he went to jail for a little bit, and he got out, and still, you know, couldn't get his land, but he bought, bought, and bought, and he got his land back.
         And, um, now, you know, every family reunion is held there and, and, um, the land is divided up, you know.
         Every little person in the family done bought a acre of land or how many acres they wanted to buy.
         Chicken coop back but ain't no chickens in it though
      .
         I don't know what they did to the chickens.
         But the, um, it's a bull out there and I think two or three cows.
         They're all over the property, and they still sell the, um, you know, they rent the land out during I guess deer season to, you know, people.
         They got to pay though, you know, to come on the property because there're deer stand all throughout.
         And I think they should make them pay to fish because big ass lake, a big old lake out there, and they, you know, I want to go fishing there, but I'm driving from out of town and it ain't like I'm carrying some fishing rods or nothing.
         They got, they got, um, I think they should make people pay to fish too, and the people it's his, it's his niece, that's my Aunt Claudia.
         She the one live on the land.
         Well she live in, she got a trailer out there and a house out there.
         They rent the house out.
         My Uncle Hubert own the house now.
         That's his, that's his son, or somebody, but he own the house.
         He rent the house and now it's nice.
         They got four wheeler trails and stuff out there now, and all kinds of stuff, four wheelers and stuff.
         You can turn that off.
         And we got, what else?
         I mean it's a nice story because I would have like to live back in them days, you know, the bootleg and moonshine stuff, myself.
         Um, you know, up there in Yanceyville.
         And, um, what else?
         We, oh you ride pass there now, you know, like we going to the family reunion, you just be riding down because you got to ride.
         Lord, let me tell you about the ride.
         You ride down way out in the country first of all, then you make a left turn.
         That's all I remember.
         Yeah you make this left turn and you driving for about five miles, and then you past part of the lake, you go on down and then you see the mailbox.
         You think it, you think you are at, um, Aunt, well Aunt Claudia, well she live, you know, directly on the property, but, um, my granddaddy Owen property, my great, great, great granddaddy Owen property and the mailbox is at the end of the street, and you turn, make a right and get on this dirt road.
         And you driving for about two more miles
      , two more miles and, I kid you not, you driving for about two more miles, but that's, um, that's is the prettiest scenery you will ever see because you, you see the lake on the right.
         You see deer running in and out, you know, just crossing street and carrying on, but they need to pave that road because ain't nothing but a buck of dirt and you get on down there.
         But the house on the property is sweet.
         I know why Aunt Claudine don't live in the house.
         She want to live in the trailer.
         I'll quit renting that out but it ain't her house anyway, ain't her property, but anyway, back to the story.
         Yeah they finally done took all of his stuff, well tried to take all of his stuff but he got it all back and he was a popular guy, you know, and, um, he start bootlegging again and, you know, still the same sheriff or whatever but he, the sheriff, they squash their little beef, or what not, and the sheriff told him, you know, was telling him when he really need to get out and finally, he got smart and he just did it.
         And he stop for real and that was that.
         But everybody talk about how cool my, my, um, great, great, great granddaddy was.
         Granddaddy Owen.
         That's who I'm named after, and I think that's why I am so cool too, and uh that's that, I mean.
      
   

   
   
      
         Welcome back to our show!
         OK.
         This is Maria, and I don't know your last name.
      
      
         Polk.
      
      
         Oh that's good.
         From Polkton, Maria Polk.
         OK.
         And where did you grow up?
         Were you born in this area here?
      
      
         I was born in Cottonville.
         Right outside of Norwood in Stanley County.
      
      
         Oh, OK.
         When you were little, did your mom read you books, or did somebody read you books in your house?
      
      
         My mama read to me and my sister.
      
      
         Uh-huh.
         What kind of books were your favorites?
         Do you remember any that were maybe a real favorite of yours?
      
      
         Mm, I kind of liked them all.
         Um, I didn't really have a favorite.
      
      
         No?
         Any particular types, like ones with pictures or
         .
         Can you think of a story that they told you that you liked for them to read over and over?
      
      
         Um, I think my favorite was like, "Little Red Riding Hood;" I loved that book.
      
      
         "Little Red Riding Hood"?
         So when you read to yourself did you read different stories than the ones they would read to you?
      
      
         Mmm, basically, something different.
      
      
         Did you get to go to the library when you were little?
      
      
         Uh-huh, all the time.
      
      
         Yeah.
         So, you would check books out?
      
      
         Uh-huh.
         Mostly, I liked to spend time reading encyclopedias--
      
      
         Oh, really?
      
      
         --when I was little.
      
      
         You like to read encyclopedias.
         In your family, do you remember if there was any storyteller?
      
      
         Well, my uncle was always telling stories and, uh, we had this house across the street from where I grew up that was old and he ever finished it.
         He started it and he told stories that, um, um, men being in it that house at night and stuff and for us not to go outside at night.
      
      
         Would he scare you?
      
      
         Yeah.
         So we, at a certain time, we were scared to go over there because we'd always go outside and look at the house across the street.
      
      
         Um, did he tell stories to big groups of people, or just one-on-one?
      
      
         Just to our cousins and all of us that hung around each other all the time.
      
      
         Uh-huh.
         Now, do you have kids at your house?
      
      
         No.
         Only, only on Sunday: my niece and nephew and my cousins.
      
      
         Uh-huh.
         Do you like to read to them?
         Do they bring their books over?
      
      
         I read to my niece.
         She likes the pop-out books.
      
      
         Uh-huh.
         How old is she?
      
      
         She's, ah
         six.
         She likes the pictures that pop out at you.
         She likes for me to read them to her.
      
      
         Can she read to herself yet?
      
      
         Not yet, but she tries to.
         Mostly, she just looks at the pictures.
      
      
         Is she, what grade is she in?
         Do you know?
      
      
         She's in kindergarten.
      
      
         She's in kindergarten?
         OK.
         That's pretty much all I need to know, about how you liked reading and things when you were little.
         Is there anything else you'd like to say about this, that comes to your mind?
      
      
         No, not so much.
      
   

   
   
      
         male voiceSTART OF TAPE 1, SIDE A
      
      
         This is Stephanie Prevatte
         with interview three.
      
      
         Oh my God!
         OK I had the worst day ever.
         OK I go up to this oil change place, right?
         And, um, I say, "OK the reason," OK I'm going to start from the very beginning.
      
      
         OK.
      
      
         I drove by this place going to work.
         It's down on Harris by Albemarle, right?
         There's a big sign out front, huge sign, "Free tire rotation with oil change".
         So I call when I get home to get their prices to compare to the University Lube where I normally get it done and it's 26 dollars for an oil change with free tire rotation, which was much cheaper than the University.
         So I'm like, "All right I'm going to go there, get my shit done, I needed a uh a tire rotation."
         So I go in there, only person there.
         I pull in, I say, "I need my inspection done," my inspection went out in November, "and an oil change with the free tire rotation," that's what I said.
         He goes, "OK we'll take care of you," and so I go sit in the waiting room and read my little book.
      
      
         This is the place you were talking bout?
      
      
         Yes it's down by, uh, it's called Pennzoil.
         Don't ever go there
         .
         And, uh, so--
      
      
         You seemed so excited about it.
         
      
      
         Oh yeah, oh yeah!
         So I pull in and he gets, he starts, "We're going to do the inspection first."
         So here he comes.
         He said, "Uh, ma'am?
         Uh, your wiper blades are getting kind of dull."
         
         He said, "You might need to replace them soon."
         And I said, "Well, you know, I'll let my dad handle them."
         He said, "Well," you know what he said?
         "I might not even pass your inspection.
         You might need to just need to go ahead and get them today."
         I said, "Fine how much are they?"
         He goes, "Six dollars a blade."
         I said, "OK put me some new wiper blades on there."
         12 dollars whoopty crap.
         
         So five minutes later he comes back in there.
         "Ma'am," he's got this sheet of paper.
         "Right here.
         I need to show you your fan belt's cracking."
         
         I said, "All right."
         
         Uh he said, I said, "Can I see it?
         You know, for my own eyes?"
         He said, "Sure come on out here."
         I did not see one crack.
         He said, apparently, it's supposed to look like this.
         There was not one crack in this belt.
         I said, "I'm not paying," I said, "How much is it?"
         He said, "49.
         99, plus installation."
         I said, "I'm not paying that.
         That's my dad's kind of stuff," I said.
         He said, "It could strand you one day."
         He said, "I, it's not real bad right now but if it gets worse it could.
         If it goes your car is going to just stop running."
         So I was like well, I'll let my dad handle that over Christmas, I'll be home `fore I know it, you know.
         Then I go.
         All right, go back in, different guy, they're doing the oil change now, comes in, he goes, "Uh you wanted a tire rotation right?"
         I said, "Yeah."
         He said, "You want the balance with it too?"
         I said, "Well, what comes free?"
         You know?
         "Do you get both of them free or just the, uh, tire rotation?"
         He goes, "Free?"
         I said, "Yeah.
         The big sign out front, and I called and got the price on the, the oil change and tire change."
         He says, "Oh, oh, oh we don't do that on Saturdays we're so busy."
         I'm the only car in the damn garage
         .
         I say, "Well I want you to know that I just drove 15 minutes to get here and didn't go to my normal place, where I know the people because of this huge great deal y'all have going on," you know?
         And he goes, "Oh no, no, no, no, no.
         Oh not on Saturdays, not on Saturdays.
         Only, oh only on the weekdays, only on the weekdays."
         I said, "All right."
         I said, "Fine."
         He said, "Do you still want the tire rotation?
         We've already started it."
         I said, "Yeah, finish it, don't balance it."
         That's another like damn 15 dollars.
         MV: 15 to balance the tires.
         MH: Yeah.
         So you get it during the week but you don't get on the other days.
         Twenty-seven dollars I wouldn't pay for it but I'd be like change the damn tires.
      
      
         So I go, yeah, I said, I said, "Well, at least put in little print on there `Except Saturdays'."
         It does not even say that, you know?
         I said, "I saw the sign, I was excited, I got, had a Saturday off, I come in," you know?
         OK, so anyways, so, comes back in he's all mad as hell and I was like, "What now?"
         Oh and before this, this dude comes up and he's getting his oil changed, or whatever, and I was like, "How you doing?"
         You know, I'm talking to him and I'm like, "You getting an oil change?"
         And he goes, "Yeah."
         And I said, "You expecting to get your tires rotated for free?"
         And he said, "Yeah!"
         "That's why I came to this one I was all excited I saw the sign, you know?"
         I said, "Well I hate to tell you.
         Not on Saturdays you ain't going to get your tires rotated."
         "What?"
         he said, "That's why I came here," and dadadadada.
         He said, "I normally go to this other place."
         And I said, "Well they're not going to do it."
         He said, "Well screw it.
         I'm not," he said, he said, "How much is it?"
         I said, "15 dollars."
         He's like, "Well I'm not going to leave.
         They've already got my car up on the thing.
         I'll just pay it."
         He's like, "That's," you know, "I'm going to say something to them."
         He's like, "That's just screwed up."
         And, um, so anyways, were talking about it and I was telling him how he kept coming in about the blades and the fan belt and he said, "Yeah, they're out, they're going to do that tell them not to worry about anything."
         So there comes the little man.
         He says, "I need to talk to you out here."
         He takes me out of the waiting room he goes, "I am very upset," and he has this in his hands and he goes--
      
      
         Oh God.
      
      
         Yeah, he goes, "I am very upset I have been trying and trying to get this lug out of your tire and it will not come out and I am very upset.
         It's almost to break, and my manager said, `do not do it, do not do it, do not do it,' so I put your tires back on
         and I am not going to rotate your tires.
         I am very frustrated with this lug."
         And I said, "OK," you know, "calm down."
         Like, "That's fine," you know, "what's the problem?"
         Why, he said, "I don't know.
         Who did your tires last?"
         And I said, "I don't know, I don't write down who does my tires."
         And so he goes--
      
      
         He's got the lug.
         
      
      
         Yeah so he goes, "I'm going to break it, if I try to put back in I'm going to break it."
         And I said, "OK."
         He said, "I'm going to try.
         I'm just telling you, you tell your father that I did not break this it was already broken."
         So he goes, so he goes, "I'm putting your tires back.
         I will not rotate your tires."
         He said, "My manager said that was OK."
         And I said, "Fine, fine, fine."
         So I go back in the waiting room and I'm like, "All right dude.
         Now they can't rotate my tires," you know?
         "Something about some lug nut."
         Now I didn't have this right then.
         He still had it in his hand.
         Ten minutes later, I mean I was there for like an hour or so.
         He said, oh I said, "How long is it going to take, because I wanted to get my book out of the car if I need to take to read."
         "Oh no, not long at all.
         No one here, no wait," you know?
         So he comes back in, he has this in his hand, he says, "Here put this in your pocketbook.
         You take this to the dealership and you have then put it back on there.
         I will not do it anymore.
         I, I tried and I tried and it will not go back in."
         And I'm like--
      
      
         It's broke.
      
      
         Yeah, no kidding.
         So I'm like, "OK."
         So I put it in my pocketbook.
         I'm like, so I'm just going to drive without a lug in my tire.
         He's like, "You have five other ones, you'll be fine.
         
         Just take it to the dealership."
         I'm like, "All right, fine.
         Just put my tires back on, finish my oil change, and let me, you know, get the hell out of here."
         So the guy that came in like 15 minutes after me is gone.
         They didn't rotate, oh, oh, oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.
         So the guy comes back in, and I'm like, "If he's coming for me I'm about to be really upset with these people.
         I'm about to call my dad."
         And say, "I just can't handle this."
         So the guy comes in, he takes the other guy out, and says, "I need to talk to you."
         
         He takes him out there, he says, he asked, I could hear, I mean it's right outside the door.
         He goes, "How do the people that normally rotate your tires do it?
         How do they get the lugs off?"
         He says, "Sir, that's not my job.
         I don't watch them take the lugs out.
         I don't know how they do it.
         That's why I bring it to people like you who are professionals with your big machines and things."
         "Well I cannot do it.
         I cannot get them off.
         I cannot rotate your tires."
         So the guy was like, "Fine, leave them on."
         He didn't want him to take them off and then not be able to get them back on.
         So he goes, "Fine leave my tires on don't take them off."
         So then he's getting his oil changed and he leaves.
         And then this other lady comes in and I warn her.
         I'm like, "You might just want to back out now because, you know, this is major problems at this place."
         And so she's watching them and they come about two or three times.
         "You're low on transmission fluid and something squeaking here and"--
      
      
         That's supposed to be part of an oil change, Stephanie.
      
      
         Yeah, no kidding.
         
         So she was like watching them like a hawk.
         Anyways, he comes in and I'm like, "Oh God here he comes again," you know?
         He's like, "You're done."
         I'm like, "Thank God," you know.
         So I go over there and he's like, "Your total is 68 something or other."
         I went, because normally, inspection's what, like 10 dollars?
      
      
         20.
      
      
         See my dad, well, where, I guess it's because it's our hometown, but we normally pay 10 dollars.
      
      
         I usually pay 20.
      
      
         And it was 20.
         I go, "How'd on," I said, "What did I just get charged for 60 some dollars?"
         He goes, "The inspection was 20, then you got to pay for the sticker three dollars, your wiper blades 17."
         Did he not say six dollars a wiper blade?
         Hmmm.
         Seventeen for the wiper blades, which he's already put on, I can't do anything about it.
         Twenty-seven for the oil change.
         When I called, I had it written down in my damn little thing.
         I pull this out I said, "So when I called the other day," I said, "they told me 25.99, if you want the free tire rotation, 18.99, if you don't, you just get the oil change."
         I said, "First of all," I said, "I wasn't going to get a free oil, free tire rotation to begin with, so I shouldn't have been charged, and not even 25.99, 27.99."
         I said, "I shouldn't have even been charged that to begin with."
         I said, "Then, he didn't get my lug nut back on," I said, "so I didn't get the tire rotation and I have a broken lug nut."
         I said, "And then, you're still going to charge me 26.99?"
         I said, "No way."
         I said, "What is going on here, I don't you know.
         I'm not happy with what's going on."
         You know, I'm getting mad.
         He's like, "Fine, we will change it to the other price."
         He's like, "I guess they put it in wrong."
         So he gives me the receipt and it's still not 18.99, it's 19.99.
         It's a dollar but it's still just annoying that they're dollaring me here, dollaring me there.
         So my total was 58 dollars total.
      
      
         Oh my God.
      
      
         And then I pull off, and they didn't change my damn sticker for my next, how many miles are you suppose to do?
      
      
         Every three.
      
      
         Three thousand?
         I was worried about that.
         I thought they put two less.
         So I pull, I thought it was four thousand so I pull off and I see that they didn't do it.
         I was like, "Goddamn."
         I get in the car and I say, "Can I get a sticker for my next oil change, please?"
         And he goes, "Yeah, sorry.
         They should have done that."
         I said, "Well, they didn't."
         So he puts it back on there and he goes, oh, he said, um, "Come, come back and talk to your dad and visit us and we'll do your fan belt."
         I said, "Uh-huh, that's OK, thank you."
         Pulled off, oh, I called my dad.
         I was like, "You will not believe \\what I just."
         \\
      
      
         \\What did your dad say?
         \\
      
      
         \\He was livid.
         \\ MH: Is he going to call?
      
      
         He was like, I mean he ain't going to call but he was like, first off he was mad about the inspection being 20 dollars.
         He was like, he said, "You shouldn't have, yeah, you shouldn't have done it."
         But they didn't tell me prices, and he was like that's why, that's why he'd rather do it, they take advantage of little girls like us coming in these places.
      
      
         They do.
      
      
         Uh, I was mad and then they don't even vacuum your car.
         Don't most oil places oil change places vacuum your car out?
         Anyways, I'm tired of talking about this it's just the worst experience of my life and I'm not very happy.
      
   

   
   
      
         My earliest recollection is with my Aunt Mary.
         Um, Mom and Dad were married on August the ninth, 1937, and that was my mama's birthday.
         That's when my mom and dad were married and they both are from here.
         My dad was Earl Wilson Propst and he was born and raised, uh, downtown Concord.
         If you remember the sign, it was down next to the Red Pig, right on Corben Avenue.
      
      
         Uh-huh.
      
      
         They just tore that old building down where the house was.
         My mom, uh, grew up on, in an area near Blackwelder's Toyland.
         Do you remember that?
      
      
         Uh-huh.
      
      
         I don't know if you remember that or not.
      
      
         Uh-huh.
      
      
         But, uh, she grew up where the 7-Eleven is now.
         There's a real pretty, old, two-story clapboard house and that's where she grew up.
         Um, but they were married in 1937, and had, uh, my three brothers and I. But, uh, and my dad died in 1969, died January 1969 of lung cancer.
         Uh, died in Madison, WI.
         The Mayo Clinic up there.
      
      
         Uh-huh.
      
      
         My mom never got over that, um, just really, really close to him.
         And she just, after all those many years, she never got over it.
         Uh, but she did an admirable job.
         I think so far.
         She is still living and, uh, somewhat healthy.
         She does have Alzheimer's.
      
      
         Uh-huh.
      
      
         But other than that, she's a lot of fun and has a wonderful personality, but my dad and she both came from big families.
         My mom came from a family, she had six brothers and sisters and she was a Calloway.
         Her mother, my grandmother on my mom's side was a Howell and that was Howell Baptist Church down towards Monroe on 601, down towards Monroe.
         So that's where they were from.
         Um, and my dad came from a big family.
         He, he had 10 brothers and sisters.
         And, uh, as I said he grew up in town but his parents, my grandparents originally lived out on the eastern part of Cabarrus County, which is, uh, they lived out Gold Hill Road and Irish Potato.
      
      
         Uh-huh.
      
      
         Uh, probably sometime around the turn of the century, just prior to the turn of the twentieth century, they did move into town
         and they built an old house and lived
         , excuse me, where, uh, Heilig-Meyers is.
         I think your church just did a thing with, uh, Concord.
      
      
         Uh-huh.
      
      
         But there was an old house there next to the Brown Livery Stable.
         That's where my great-grandfather William Propst and his wife, my great-grandmother Etta, Caroline Etta Ritchie Propst lived.
         But as I said, what I'm getting to my Aunt Mary.
         My dad had a sister
         had several sisters had three had four sisters, but there was one, her name was Mary Propst, Mary Elizabeth Propst.
         She never married and lived to be, she was born in 1901, August tenth 1901, August ninth rather.
         My mother was the tenth and she was the ninth.
         She lived to be about 95 years old, never married, was a schoolteacher, I like to say, all her life.
      
      
         Uh-huh.
      
      
         As most teachers are, uh, which is, I guess, the first thing that I learned to admire about her.
         And, uh, that's where my respect for all teachers comes from, from her.
         She was also a principal.
         She was a schoolteacher and a principal at what was Clara Harris.
      
      
         Uh-huh.
      
      
         A school near town, and, um, but--
      
      
         It's hard to believe that somebody could be \\ both a teacher and a principal.
         \\
      
      
         \\And she was.
         \\ There's a story.
         I guess probably some 10 to 12 years ago.
         We had one of many bond referendums, school bond referendums, that I was really working hard on.
         And Mary, uh, read in the paper one day about the bond referendums.
         It was 22, 23 million dollars, an incredible amount of money, and she asked me to come down.
         She wanted to talk to me about this bond referendum.
         She wanted to know all about it.
         You know, "Why are we doing this?"
         "What do we need the money for?
         How is it going to be spent?"
         She genuinely--
      
      
         Uh-huh.
      
      
         She was a voter.
         Although she was 92 or 93 at the time, she was going to get in her car and go vote one way or the other.
         And so, I would try to explain to her how it was very important, with all the growth we were experiencing in Cabarrus County, to keep the, uh, the number of kids in the classrooms to less than 30 if we could, and we weren't meeting that with the growth.
         So we needed to fix up some buildings and try to keep that.
         And she said, "I understand.
         I understand," and I went on further to say, you know, just, just, I gave several reasons that she, she agreed with.
         And I went a little bit too far I said, uh, "And besides, you know, when kids get up to around 30, a classroom size of 30, these teachers could never do it without an assistant."
         
         She said to me, she says, "An assistant with 30!"
         She says, "My, when I was coming up, you know well I, I had 40 and 50 students, and I didn't have an assistant and I was principal."
         
         She didn't say it that way she didn't mean it that way.
         I said, "Yes ma'am."
         
         But the kids didn't come prepared like they did then.
         They didn't come disciplined, uh, now as they did then.
         And, um, and I believe that.
         But, but my Aunt Mary, again, she was a very instrumental part of my life.
         I love history and I love genealogy and it is because of her that I do.
         Um
         , her, her grandfather, pardon me, yes, my great-grandfather, was William Propst.
         I forgot now that when he was born, probably, uh probably sometime around 18, 1828, 1830, 1831.
         He served in the Civil War as a captain, 57th Regiment out of Cabarrus County and he didn't die, uh, until the early 20's.
         Lived to be almost, almost a hundred.
         And as I said Mary never married.
      
      
         Uh-huh.
      
      
         And she lived in the house there at Corben and, and Church Street.
         Um, and when my great-grandmother died, sometime in the early teens, my great-grandfather came back with, to live with my grandparents and Mary.
         And she took care of this man.
         And to this day, it's, it's phenomenal, it's a fantastic story.
         My wife, initially, Annette really couldn't understand why I would get so excited about it.
         But here I am, I knew and became very close to someone, my Aunt Mary, who in turn took care of my great-grandfather, and knew well, was old enough to recollect, you know, his stories.
      
      
         Right.
      
      
         Not only of the Civil War, but of his childhood.
      
      
         Uh-huh.
      
      
         And it is fascinating.
         It's fascinating some of which I've got on tape.
         Um, she would never allow me to video.
         But I got a good bit of that on tape and, uh, just interviews similar to this, uh, fascinating.
      
      
         Uh-huh.
      
      
         I recall her talking about how she cared for him once he did come back from the war and he had a smallpox scar that he always had problems with, which I understand there was a lot of that.
         But, especially through the war years, he would write her and talk about, you know, his arm and she knew exactly what it was.
         But, uh, uh, or, or she didn't know at the time, but later he, he described that, and she recalled taking care of it even, even in the later years of his life.
         Just a lot of different stories.
         But she, he had, my great-grandfather had written a lot of letters, during the Civil War, home to my great-grandmother.
         And, uh, fortunately, Mary kept them all those years, and then when she passed away, just a few years ago, she left them to me.
         And so it's amazing reading the history of those letters, not just, not just the history of the war, but the letters, what they talked about.
         They have a plantation, probably five or 600 acres out at Irish Potato Road at the time, and a lot of what the letters talked about to my great-grandmother were ideas of what to do.
      
      
         Uh-huh.
      
      
         If you could imagine and, and let me say this, some of the letters that I have, that I love the most, that are dearest to me are some of the letters that, that she wrote him.
         And he were, he was able to get.
      
      
         Uh-huh.
      
      
         And to know that he kept them and then brought them home.
         So these are some of the dearest letters.
         And in reading her letters to him, wherever he might be, a lot of the letters come from, obviously in and around Fredericksburg, VA in 1862, 1863.
         And, uh, she would ask, "What do we do now about the wheat?
         What do we do about the oats?
         What do we do about the cattle?
         What do we do about this?
         What about this timber?"
      
      
         Uh-huh.
      
      
         You know, "You always talked about doing--.
         So and so has called me.
         Do I trust this man?"
         You know, you think about it, uh, probably prior to the Civil War, she, she didn't have this information.
      
      
         Uh-huh.
      
      
         You know they probably, she, if you think about it, she, not that he kept anything from her, it's just that, uh, she probably took care of the house, if you will.
      
      
         Uh-huh.
      
      
         And he, in turn, took care of the other affairs.
         And all of a sudden he's up and gone for four years, for three and a half years.
         Similar situation happened with my parents, uh, just, you know, WWII.
         But, uh, then he would respond, you know, "Well you can trust this man or you can't trust this person," or, "I would suggest that you do this."
         But always to a "t."
         He would always, you could see the respect building in him for her.
         "But you do what you think is right.
         Here's, I'm trying to answer some of your questions, but, and this is what I think maybe you might want to consider doing."
      
      
         Uh-huh.
      
      
         "But you, and I will support you.
         Here I am not knowing if I'll ever come home."
      
      
         Right.
      
      
         And so it's just, it's just a wonderful history.
         So Mary established, I guess, what I was getting, she established the love I have for family.
      
   

   
   
      
         Matthew Purdie.
         I've been asked to recount the story of how I first came to be going out with my present girlfriend, who, more than likely, I will end up marrying in year and a half or so.
         Well the story goes something like this: Late November, early December, don't remember which, 1990, 1990 I had a dream.
         I was marrying this one particular individual woman.
         And as I drove to school the next day with my best friend, a guy I've known longest in the world, Jeffrey Mossier, we discussed this dream I had.
         And, we discussed it, and he said, "Wow!"
         And I said, "Jeffrey, I'm probably going to marry this girl."
         And, well, that was like nine years ago.
         [Clears throat] So, you know, we got to know each other a little better; we'd gone to school together since the seventh grade.
         And we started doing that flirting thing, you know, acting like boyfriend and girlfriend, flirting, doing this, that, and the other, but nothing officially ever happened.
         So one day, a band fruit day, a very nasty day, kinda funny, I asked her out to a movie.
         It caught her a little bit off guard and she said, "Yes."
         And we went and saw one of the poorest movies I've ever seen in my life, Three Men and a Little Lady.
         It's the sequel to Three Men and a Baby.
      
      
         Uh-huh.
      
      
         Anyway, we went and saw that movie; both of us hated, hated it and I think we may have actually hold, held hands together in the last half of the movie.
         Didn't kiss.
         Then we went to Baskin-Robbins and she got some Chocolate Gold Caramel Ribbon ice cream and I got Mint Chocolate Chip, and we ate and we made a mess and I drove her home.
         And that was our first date and how we met.
      
      
         
         So what happened after that?
      
      
         Oh, after that?
         All kinds of things.
      
      
         Because obviously you're still dating her and it's been five years.
      
      
         We went to the prom together, junior year.
         That was exciting.
         She was wearing this big, huge, green Cinderella dress that she won't allow me to mention any longer because she hates it now.
         And then, I ended up giving her my high school class ring, cheesy!
         And on November the first, this is a good story, playing Ultimate Frisbee with my buddies on Halloween Day, and I dove to knock the Frisbee out of somebody's hand.
         I dove in front of them, and as I dove in front him, he grabbed the back of my shirt, sent all my weight forward, and I ended up landing on my thumb and my index finger of my left hand, right hand, and broke a couple of balls in my wrist.
         Had to wear a cast for five or six weeks and then another little cast for five or six weeks after that.
         Stinky hand because I couldn't wash it.
         Anyway, the night afterwards, November the first, we had gone to a football game in Greensboro, or Gastonia, Ashbrook.
         And, after the game was over, we got back to school and we talked out in the parking lot for what seems to be forever.
         And I asked her if she wanted to wear it since I couldn't, because it would, you know, the hand had the cast on it.
         Anyway, she said, "Yeah, sure," and we giggled and laughed and then we went our separate ways and went home.
         So all senior year, we went out about every Friday, movies, hanging out with friends, doing whatever.
         And we had a very, very, we went to the prom together.
         Then, sometime in June or July, after we graduated, we had a really long talk about what we were going to do because we were going to different colleges.
      
      
         What schools were you going to?
      
      
         I went to NC State University in Raleigh, NC, she went to Wake Forest University in Winston-Salem, NC.
         And it's only an hour, hour and a half, hour and 45 minutes drive, depending on the traffic, depending on how fast you fly above the road.
         But we had a talk about whether or not we wanted to continue dating or whether we wanted to break it off or whether we wanted to continue dating but allow the other to date other people while we were in college.
         And well, the consensus was, we should probably keep in touch but that we should give each free reign to, to date other people.
         Well, low and behold, that never happened for either one of us.
         And we made it, all through six years of college, together, discussing quite often whether or not we were going to end up marrying each other.
         And while, she ended up taking a job in Atlanta, which was a little bit further from Charlotte than Winston-Salem was, and she wanted me to move down there.
         And well I hate the town.
         The town's too big for its own good.
         But I did try to get a job down there, teaching.
         Didn't make her happy at all.
         But well, we've gone through, some little fights here and there about whether or not I wanted to be down in Atlanta and whether I really wanted to be with her, and whether she really wanted to be with me, if I didn't really want to follow her at all, all the way down there.
         She thought that.
         But anyway, she, is probably going to move back here and we will probably get married, and have kids, and live the happily ever after Cinderella little story because I am Prince Charming and she is, the Princess.
         What other story shall I tell?
      
      
         If that's all you want to say, that's fine.
      
   

   
   
      
         Just talk?
      
      
         Just talk.
      
      
         OK, um, we, um, live in Matthews, NC.
         We are here from Dayton, OH.
         We've been here about 13 years and we have two children, Wes and Megan, who, uh, one just finished college and one other one is, uh, Megan is a junior at Carolina this, this fall.
         Um, we have enjoyed, I guess, our move here, and the people we've met and all, just the differences, I guess.
         We kind of had some, uh, not reservation about moving, it was an elective move for us, but certainly, um, living in a different part of the country than we were used to was, uh, something which was a change for us and something that we had thought long about.
         But coming here, rather than, um, perhaps picking up and focusing on the differences, I think we tried to look at the, uh, you know, just the, um, the, the special points about the, uh, life in the South and, and the people here and the customs and I think it's been something that we've always, uh, valued.
         Some, some folks, uh, either, uh, from the South don't value the people from the North and vice versa, but I think it's been a real positive thing, our move for us, in many ways.
         And, uh, it was a little harder on our children, particularly, uh, Wes.
         Um, he was at a, just, uh, had a real good group of kids, or boys, that he was friends with and did lots of things with.
         And when he came here, uh, you know, having to start all over for him was difficult.
         And I think it took him a little while, uh, longer than our daughter, who fit in I think with a group of people pretty quickly.
         We've been involved in the area, in our neighborhood.
         
         There's a neighborhood association we've been involved in that pretty strongly.
         We've, um, we're members of Matthew's United Methodist Church and have been there for almost the 13 years that we've been here and have had various, um, areas of participation and leadership there, and have been pretty much a part of the community.
         Um, we have a fairly strong family.
         Uh, we have family in all parts of the country or at least this part of the United, this part of the, uh, Eastern United States, in VA and KY.
         And just had a family member move here from KY three years ago.
         And, uh, my wife's family is scattered, uh, back in OH and in FL and Denver, CO. But we find that a, a fairly intentional way, every year, of getting together and we enjoy just, uh, doing some fairly mundane things.
         But when we get together, we, um, that is, we just enjoy eating food, we enjoy putting puzzles together, we sometimes go to the beach and just do as little as we can as possible, and just enjoy, you know, doing things together.
         So we have a fairly, um, I would say, strong family and important to us, and are fairly intentional about getting together as often as we can.
         Um-
      
      
         What are some of the differences you noticed when coming down here from, that you mentioned-
      
      
         Differences, well, it's uh,
         I think there's, you know, just different, uh, phrases, and different ways of saying things.
         I think that, uh, it will take a while for me to get used to "mashing" a button on an elevator or, or, um, I'm just trying to think of, instead of taking someone home that you would "carry" them home or carry them to the store.
         We picked up pretty easily the, um, phrase for, you know, "Hello," or a greeting is "Hey!"
         And usually that was something you said up north to get someone's attention.
         Like, "Hey, you!"
         or "Hey!
         Over there!"
         But here it's just a greeting and we've gone back to visit in OH or elsewhere and we, pretty much it's just become a part of our language or usage as well and, um, you know, people ask us about it.
         But we've picked up some things and then certainly there are other things that, language wise, we, um, still find, uh, a little different to get used to.
         Uh, I think that, I don't know, I guess, in terms of pace of life, I don't know that it's a lot different from what we were used to.
         I think that maybe in the northeast you would find maybe things to be more hectic or people to be perhaps less friendly, but I think it pretty much depends on who you are and where you are and the kind of person you are as, as to whether or not you, you know, make friends easily or whether, you know, you actually put people off.
         To my mind that doesn't really matter what part of the country you are from.
         It seems if you're used to, if you're, if it's in your nature, you know, to treat people with respect that you don't have that, you know, problem fitting in.
         Uh, but if you try to emphasize I guess, differences then I think then that's probably another issue.
         One thing that was kind of interesting, too was that we, uh, you know, just some strange things about Charlotte, in fact, is that when we came here, well, we're, back in OH, I mean, there's a fairly, uh, developed, very well developed library system.
         And there, I mean, just good libraries and large libraries in neighborhoods and certainly the downtown area.
         When we came here they were just finishing the new main library in uptown Charlotte, but still there were, uh, libraries in storefronts on Independence Blvd.
         There was a small library over on Sharon Rd.
         or actually on Fairview Rd.
         , it was the Sharon Library, and a very small one in Matthews and, and the rest were just hither and yon.
         And now we have one of the, I guess, well-recognized library systems and probably the better ones in the United States.
         We have regional libraries that have just seemed to have grown up in both the University area and Rea Rd.
         and, uh, South Park and other places.
         And it's just amazing how much change there's been, a, a dramatic change there has been just in that one institution alone.
         Um, and you look at other kinds of things and I think Charlotte, and maybe it's typical of the South, but I think that, uh, maybe there hasn't been as much growth here before and when you have growth and you have people coming in, who, looking for services.
         And you, and you also have a, a government, um, who are, are really ready to take that challenge as opposed to just deciding that, "Hey, listen we're gonna do things the way we've done it for the last, you know, 100 years, whether new people come or need services or ask for amenities or not, we're going to keep things the way they are."
         In fact, the town of Matthews, I think, um, at least my understanding is, is that when Providence Plantation, uh, reached a certain point in population they, they wanted to be annexed to the town of Matthews because they thought maybe that the city of Charlotte would annex them and so they wanted to, that they petitioned the town of Matthews to annex.
         But the town of Matthews at that point said, "No," because they were afraid that all these people from other places would come in and be a part of the town government and change things.
         And so they decided to, you know, basically vote the outsiders out and it will keep the town, uh, small.
         But Matthews has grown many times, uh, just in the last 15 years.
         And, and, and certainly the, the leadership has changed there.
         And, uh, you know, there is a more inclusive, uh, government there.
         Um, other differences, uh, I think we, we miss a park system, a little better organized park system.
         We were used to, um, probably some smaller parks and, and, and larger parks, regional parks and state parks.
         But we would often go to, to hike, and actually they had cabins and things like that, other activities and, with them that we did.
         Um, but people-wise, I think we've, we've found people to be probably pretty much the, what you hear about in the South.
         And that is the Southern house, hospitality and the people are, for the most part, warm and friendly and, um, and, and that's been a just a, a really a nice, nice part about moving here.
         I think that I, it just depends on what the accent is, but I could sit and listen for hours to, to certain southern accents.
         I enjoy listening, uh, to people who have grown up in the area and who speak with that accent.
         It used to be when you could come here that uh,
         that still the people who were native to Charlotte or to the South were the greatest number of the population.
         And now it seems like, at least in the place where I work and other people we run into, a lot of people, uh, seem to be from other places and fewer people, you know, are just native to uh, to the Carolinas or, um, to the South.
         Um
         just trying to think of other things that might be difference
         .
         Well, I guess, I work for the city of Charlotte and I'm probably partial, uh, to, to governments, but I worked for the City of Dayton before and also with a regional agency in Cleveland.
         And I think that, um, that in terms of at least Charlotte, if the, if the city government is, is, is at all representative of, of just the politics here, both in the private sector and the public sector, there's just a real interest in, in uh, in, in getting things done.
         And, and also, I think, not necessarily in reinventing the wheel, but in looking at everything that you do to see if there's some way that you can't do it better.
         And to reengineer processes, to, uh, to try to, again be, you know, I guess good stewards of the public's money and to, and to act in a, in a very reasonable and responsible way and to provide basic, good basic services.
         And I think that whether we're talking about, um, you know, that or we're talking about a can-do spirit to do other civic projects, public projects, partnering with the private sector, I think that there is just a real attitude to, again, be a place of excellence and to find a way to get things done.
         And that's been, uh, something which I haven't in, in other places.
         And I think Charlotte is, is recognized as not only as a, it's a business community and a growth community, but also as a community that has one of the best, um, governments, uh, in the nation for, for at least populations, cities our size.
         I think we're nationally recognized, uh, for what we do from just a managing standpoint.
         Um, and so that's been a, I think a good change for us, uh, since I work in that environment.
         One thing, is it's been difficult trying to, now, now that my family starting to move down here, I think that the one drawback was, uh, just moving probably eight hours away, driving time, from um, from Dayton.
         But now most of our family is in other places and so that's probably not as much of a factor.
         
         So I guess one question might be how I met my wife.
         Um, I guess that's a, I've known my wife for a long time.
         Uh, we grew up in the same, uh, city together.
         We went to different high schools but we went to the same church.
         And our families were friends for many years and so we were acquainted that way, but it wasn't until I was probably a sophomore in college that, uh, we started dating.
         And, um, she went to Miami University in OH, and I went to Purdue in IN, so visiting was, uh, problematic but we, we did find a way every couple of weeks to, um, to get together.
         And I guess that started in probably `71 and we were married in June of `73.
         So Susan still had, uh, a semester or two to finish.
         I was in graduate school and then we, I graduated and we went to, moved to Cleveland, she finished up.
         Even though she went to Miami for two years, Purdue for two years she still had some classes to make up, and so she went to Cleveland State and to Baldwin Wallace in Cleveland and finally graduated with a, with a degree from Purdue.
         Um, she had lost some credits in transferring.
         But we had a, it was a good way to, to start out in life.
         We, uh, lived in married student housing, we, we had a fairly, uh, tight budget.
         Um, you know, I had an assistantship with, with the university so we were pretty much sufficient on that.
         But we learned, uh, to uh, to do with, uh, very little and to, um, just enjoy, you know, getting to, I mean being together and, and knowing each other and finding neat things to do.
         And so, I think that we've, we've pretty much carried that through, uh, the rest of our life in many ways.
         I think we enjoy, you know, being together, we enjoy, um, you know, talking [clears throat] and doing some of the simple things.
         If we have other things that's great and we, we seek those out, but we're not, I mean, we're not, we enjoy spending time together and don't necessarily seek time apart.
         And we've been doing this now for about 28 years, so it's been a, a good marriage for us.
      
   

   
   
      
         Well, I was born in Queens, NY.
         And, on October twenty-fifth 1976.
         Um, my parents are still living up north.
         My father lives in Queens, NY, off of Throgs Neck Bridge in Bayside, and my mother lives in the Poconos, which is known as Stroudsburg, PA.
         I've been down here now, I would say, oh about seven, seven years now, going on eight years.
         I came down here originally on a, to play baseball in the Charlotte area at, uh, one of the colleges here in Charlotte.
         And, uh, I guess I'm what you would refer to as a "Damn Yankee" because I haven't left; I'm staying.
         Well, at least for a while I was.
         I'm presently going to be going on my way out to Denver, CO for a job opportunity.
         But, um, the reason, uh, I guess I came down here again was to play baseball.
         My father's a doctor up in Queens, NY for 35 years.
         His side of the family is Austrian Jew, and my mother's side is, uh, Roman Catholic Italian from, uh, from Brooklyn.
         And, uh--
      
      
         That's an interesting combination.
         
      
      
         That is definitely an interesting combination.
         Um, so, I don't know, um.
      
      
         When did your, um, father's family come to the United States?
      
      
         Well, he, he, I believe he is, I guess it would be, you'd refer to third generation.
         Um, I think it's his parents' parents that came over.
         Um, as far as my mother's side I'm not too sure.
         It might be roughly around the same.
         She's either she's either third or fourth generation.
         Um--
      
      
         Do you know why his parents' parents came?
      
      
         I think just like everyone else, for an opportunity.
      
      
         Uh-huh.
      
      
         Uh, an opportunity to come over here, I would, I would say, to practice medicine.
         It seems like everyone in my family is, uh, a doctor.
         And, um, the, just the same on my mother's side.
         Just for that opportunity to come to America.
         So, but, um, for myself, I love NC.
         It's a beautiful area.
         It's a lot different from the North that's for sure.
         Can't say that I've come to love grits
         , but, um, I've met my future wife.
      
      
         Is she a good Southern girl?
      
      
         She's a real good Southern girl.
         She's a religious background, religious background upbringing, which I cannot say I've been a part of.
         And, um, she's going to calm me down a lot I think and, uh, instill a lot of, instill a lot of positive aspects of my life that have thus far been deferred.
      
      
         How did you meet her?
      
      
         Well, I was fortunate enough to meet her in college, in which we were best friends for about two and a half years.
         Until, uh, finally, I don't know, the light came on, I guess, for her I should say because for myself the light came on pretty much as soon as I met her.
         And, uh, she'll be following me out to Denver, CO myself.
      
      
         Has she been up North with you?
      
      
         She has.
         She, um, we've been up recently.
         I proposed to her in Central Park.
         We were in New York City seeing my, my family.
         And my uncle was in town who, both my father and my uncle were born and raised in the Bronx, not too far from Yankee Stadium.
      
      
         And, uh, so I guess you're a big Yankee fan.
      
      
         Big time Yankee fan.
         .
         It's been a good couple of years for us Yankee fans here lately.
         And, uh, we were down on Fifty-Third Street, which is five blocks away from Central Park, and, um, my fianc�e had just passed her boards and it was our anniversary, so I decided to surprise her with walking down to Central Park off of Fifty-Eighth.
         And, um, it kind of just worked out perfect.
         I proposed to her.
         I was lucky enough for her to say, "Yes."
         And, um, so, yeah, she's been up north a couple of times and in the PA area as well the Poconos where you hear the honeymooners always go.
      
      
         Uh-huh.
      
      
         And, um, so--
      
      
         Well it sounds like you have a pretty bright future ahead of you.
      
      
         Not too bad.
         It's getting brighter and brighter, it seems, every day.
         And, um, it's going to be a new adventure for us going out to Denver, CO, with me being a pharmaceutical sales representative and my fianc�e being in the medical profession as well, being a nurse.
         And, um--
      
      
         I've heard that's a beautiful area.
      
      
         Yes it is.
         It's a lot to do.
         A lot of hiking and mountain biking.
         I don't ski.
         I think my fianc�e does a little bit.
         But, um, I don't know how much we'll do of that.
         But I would, would suspect that we would end up back up, maybe, in the Charlotte area.
         If not, NC for sure, um--
      
      
         That would probably make your in-laws very happy.
      
      
         Very happy along with my family, as well.
         Because Denver, CO seems to be a little far.
         Um, but it's good we get to start our lives together out there, and hopefully, uh, start maybe in a couple years maybe two to three years tops, four, start working on a family of our own.
         
         And, uh, that's something that I very much look forward to.
         Um, creating a family of my own.
      
      
         Now if you have sons would you want them to play baseball too?
      
      
         I would, I definitely would.
         And I would probably encourage them to come down in the NC area to play baseball.
         It's been a great experience for me.
      
      
         What was, what did you like best about playing?
         Well it was always an escape for me.
         Kept me, uh, motivated.
         Kept me out of trouble.
         
         which was the big thing, and, um, I like being competitive, I know my fianc�e is very competitive as well.
         So, I know if we do have a little boy, even a little girl, I know there might be a good chance of being some good athletes in the family.
         So, uh, yeah.
         I'll definitely want them to pursue baseball, but, by all means, it's probably going to be whatever they want to do.
         I don't want to force them or anything so--
      
      
         So where do you see yourself in about 10 years from now?
      
      
         In about ten years, definitely in the NC area.
         Um, the beach is real appealing.
         If not maybe Charlotte, probably down by Wilmington or some sort.
         Definitely like to have two children.
         And, um, have done a lot of things by that point.
      
      
         Uh-huh.
      
      
         Done a lot of traveling with my, my wife and seen a lot of things.
         In 10 years from now, start setting some sort of, ah, foundation for the family we're raising, in some sort of steady home.
         And no more making big trips out to CO, or making a big move for the company, or something of that nature.
         So, I think, uh, we should be doing OK in about 10 years.
      
   

   
   
      
         Um.
         Hi, I'm Laura Ragonese, and I'm currently living in Huntersville, NC.
         I've been there for about two and a half years, but I grew up in a small town in Connecticut and I basically came down here um, just first for the University, but then I landed a job, so I've been staying here working.
         Um, and I happened upon Charlotte and Huntersville area just on the Internet.
         I was looking for a city down south and I kind of wanted an idea as to something new, something upcoming, and from what I understand, Charlotte is a quite growing city.
         So, it seemed like a really good place to come to, and so far I really like it.
         Um, I'm going to tell you a story about a trip I took with my sisters.
         Um, I have four sisters and we're all about a year and a half apart and we're going to visit my grandmother who lives in Cape Coral, in Florida.
         So, I think it was maybe four years ago, four, four, or five years ago and um, we left, actually just three of my sisters and I went.
         And um, we left Connecticut and we were driving down, we were driving in my sister Diane's um, Ford Escort, which she'd had for about a year and a half and uh, we were driving and everything, anticipating good weather and I think we were just about right outside of Savannah, GA and I was driving the car and her car is standard and um, the clutch went out on the car.
         So, I was driving and I said to my sister Diane, "Di, I don't think, I think something is wrong with the clutch," I said, "Because it seems to be on the floor," meaning it, it wasn't, didn't feel like it was connected.
         And I um, she said, "Pull off the side of the road," so I pulled off into this um, I guess it was like a rest stop.
         But, there weren't any pay phones, a lot of truckers, few people, whatever, so we stopped and definitely the clutch was broken.
         So, my sister has a CB and so we tried to radio some people, that didn't work.
         This woman came through with a cell phone, so we called for help and this
         "honky-tonk" kind of guy,
         I don't know where he was from, he was operating basically his machine shop or his repair shop right out of this truck.
         He didn't have a license plate on his truck
         .
         He didn't have a decal saying where he worked or anything.
         So, it was kind of shady.
         But, so, it was about three or four o'clock, anyway, so we sat on the curb and waited for this guy.
         He comes first and assesses the situation and said, "I think that your clutch cable snapped and it's not really a big deal, we can rig it up, so you guys can get to where you got to go, you just have to get it fixed."
         So fine, so he leaves.
         And we flag down an officer and he comes and he tries and tells us, he proceeds to tell us there was a black belt, wait the murder belt?
         I don't know
         this guy was crazy, this cop, he said that we were in a really bad section of where people were like murdered and killed and like thrown like behind like the rest stop.
         So my sisters are sitting on the curb thinking, "Oh, my God, we're going to die, right?"
         And not to mention it's getting later in the day and it was about, I think it was late March, early April, it had to be.
         But anyways, so the sun had started descending, going down.
         Anyways, this guy comes and he fix, he must have left about four times, I don't know where he was going, but I don't know where his shop was, but every time he comes back with some crazy thing and he eventually fixed our car with some uh, chicken wire, I think he rigged it up with.
         We have no idea
         .
         Anyways, we got in the car and it got us to Savannah, GA.
         And we arrived in Savannah, um, it was Mardi Gras, was it Mar, no it was St. Patrick's Day and let me tell you there were some crazy things going on.
         The woman, the desk attendant, the hotel we checked in well, first we couldn't find any hotels, because it was booked, apparently Savannah is like really crazy around St. Patrick's Day.
         So, um, we got there and this woman had long green nails on, it was kind of crazy.
         Um, she was like OH, you guys came for the perfect time, it's um St. Patrick's Day and we're having parties and parties, and all this stuff.
         So, I couldn't go out, I think I was like 19 years old and you have to be like 21, uh, 18 in some clubs and 21 to drink, and we decided not to go out, considering everything that had happened that day.
         So, we woke up the next morning, we went down and we drove down to FL.
         I think it took us in all about 23 hours, maybe 24, because she, Cape Coral is on the West Coast.
         So, we got there and my grandma is of course excited to see us and we unpacked our stuff and everything and we proceeded to lay out in the driveway, and my younger sister Nancy, um, being her first time in the sun, decided she didn't want to use sunscreen, because she really wanted to get a good suntan, she got a good suntan, she got a sunburn.
         After we yelled at her for about three hours she decided to slap some sunburn on the back of her, suntan lotion on the back of her leg, and it left a nice white print, like hand print on the back of her leg, and the rest of her got sun burnt.
         So, then we basically um, we visited with our grandmother and I have some step family that lives down there, so one night we went out with our cousin Teddy
         and we uh, went out to some clubs with him and everything.
         Um, and then we went to, let's see For, I want to say it's Fort Myers Beach I think, the beach is on the West Coast, we went down, it's about an hour from my grandma's and uh, it's a really nice beach, it's uh, was pretty warm that day.
         I think, we all got some color, but they were having an epidemic of red tide and so all the fish were washing up on the shore and um, luck be it, since we were having such a good time um, Allison, Nancy, and I decide we are going to take a walk along the beach and there were fish strewn everywhere so we were careful not to step on them.
         However, Allison wasn't paying attention and she stepped on a fish and it got a barb, which is one of it's defense mechanisms, stuck in her foot, so it was really painful and her foot swelled up and everything.
         So, we go to this gas station and they tell us we have to go to the hospital, so we go to the hospital in Cape Coral and I think we were there for probably ten hours.
      
   

   
   
      
         Can I talk now?
      
      
         Yeah go ahead and try it.
      
      
         OK, I was four years old, from what my mom tells me I was four years old, and I was walking on the beach with my grandfather and apparently I stepped on a sticker bush and I had like four stickers in my foot
         .
         And it just stressed me terribly and I was crying and crying and I kept on just saying, "I need a doctor
         , I need a doctor!
         Get me a doctor!"
         
         And I guess my grandfather convinced me to take them out of my foot and I lived to tell this story.
      
      
         Good thing.
      
      
         Well, Okey-dokey
         .
         Um, let's see, some other stories that I remember, let me think.
         Stop me, can I, stop me while I think?
         Um, um.
      
      
         What stories do you tell Gage?
         Like books do you read to him?
      
      
         Um, we read, what do we read?
         We read all kinds of books.
         Whatever he pulls off of the shelf.
         And he has a hundred books.
      
      
         What's his favorite?
      
      
         Um, he doesn't really have a favorite; he picks whichever one is going that night.
         He just got a book it's called, um, Eagle Boy, and it's about a, um, a Indian tribe on the CA coast, who does, uh, they run out of food in the area where they are.
         And ( ).
         Anyway, so it's about this Indian tribe on the CA coast and wherever they are, they run out of food and they decide that they have to move.
         Well, this one little boy had always, um, been real nice to the eagles and thought they were really cool and all this, and, um, for whatever reason the tribe decides that they need to leave him behind, and they leave him on the beach as they paddle off.
         Well, he was starving and an eagle came by and dropped a salmon down for him or some fish and he was able to eat.
         And it's because he had always been nice to the eagles and talked to the eagles and all that and they saw that he was in trouble.
         Well, he really liked one of the little girls who had gone off with the rest of the tribe and so he told the eagles to drop her some food because he knew they were starving too and the eagle did.
         And then they realized that it was all because of the, him that the eagles were dropping them food, and so they came back and got him and it was one big happy tribe again.
         And the little girl and boy married and lived happily ever after.
         And so that one he just got, and he likes that one.
         Um, he likes, what other stories do we tell?
         He really likes to make up stories.
         He'll like, it's usually about a Power Ranger.
         And the Power Ranger has to overcome some huge enemy and it's usually a bloody battle
         , but the Power Ranger always wins.
         He'll make up those from Eden to Greensboro, which is 40 minutes long, and you have to do it.
         And so, he, that, he usually does that with his grandmother, and they make up a story the whole way home.
         And he tries to get me to do it, but I cannot talk to like that 40 minutes, so we just usually make it halfway with our stories.
         Um, what other stories do we tell?
      
      
         Any good life experience stories?
      
      
         No
         .
         Um, we tell Gage about, like we'll tell him about like if you do this, you know, could be hurt.
         Like, um, "When I was little I knew a boy who stuck his head out and got hit by the by the telephone pole while he was in the car and killed him.
         Don't stick your head out."
         Um
         , like when he, one time we were at my mom's house and she had just made pies and he saw them come out of the oven, and he knew they were hot but it had been sitting on the stove for a little bit.
         And he went up to grab it and he burned his fingers and so we told him, you know, times that we burned ourselves and that it hurts and that it will stop.
         And plus, you know, Rob can talk away fire so we had to call Daddy and tell him to talk away Rob, Gage's fire.
         And, um, so we tell him about that.
      
      
         How does Rob talk away this fire?
      
      
         He, he does some, I don't know.
         See, he can't tell you
         , but he does something like this, and then he has to know your birth date, your birth date, your age I don't know, something else and it, it works, I'm not kidding.
      
      
         It makes things stop hurting?
      
      
         It makes your burn stop hurting.
         The next time you burn, call Rob and he'll say, "How old are you and what's your birthday?"
         and then you just hang up and it will go away.
         He does, he says something; it's very weird.
         I'm being serious though, it works.
         I've burned myself and called him and he does it and it stops hurting.
         Now maybe if I never called him, it would just stop hurting anyway, but I don't know
         .
         So Rob can do that.
         Let's see what's another story?
         Um what's something else?
      
      
         Anything good you remember just like childhood story like something you did when you were a child, teenager?
      
      
         No teenager stories
         .
      
      
         ( )
      
      
         When you know my dad had that hearse, that convertible hearse?
         Well he used to like, there was like-
      
      
         A convertible hearse?
      
      
         You knew about that.
         You knew the hearse that he, anyway we had a neighbor who said, "I bet you can't take a hearse and make it into a convertible," and my dad said, "I bet I can."
         
         Dad went out, bought a hearse, cut off the top, and painted it like bright yellow, and it had red velvet seats in it.
         He had a convertible top made for this stupid thing.
         I mean, oh my gosh, it was in our garage for years
         .
         Anyway, so Dad, Dad made this convertible hearse and he used to take all the neighborhood kids, and there was like ten of us.
         He put us all in the hearse and we would go hooker hunting downtown.
      
      
         Hooker what?
      
      
         Hooker hunting
         !
         So, we'd go downtown and go, "There's one!"
         
         But see, and really it was just to go to Dairy Queen, `cause you had to go downtown to go to Dairy Queen, and he was really taking us all for ice cream
         .
         But we used to call it hooker hunting
         .
         And so, the kids would come over and go, "Phil can we go hooker hunting?"
         We'd do that and, um, that's my dad, Jesus!
         What else would my dad do?
         My dad did all kinds of crazy things to our house.
         He would he had the canoe strung up in the tree on a pulley system so all he would have to do is pull the car up underneath the tree and he'd let the canoe down on the car, unhook it
         back by the hearse was the canoe in the tree.
         Damn, to be me.
      
   

   
   
      
         Hi my name is Sandra Reid and I am part of a family of seven children, um, and my mom and dad have passed away.
         During our young years we were very poor.
         
         We did not have very much but my mom always found a way to keep us busy or keep us entertained, and one of the ways that she kept us entertained was by telling stories, reading poems, and singing to us.
         One of the stories that I would like to share with you is the story that is pretty scary and it sticks out into my mind, I guess, mostly, mainly because it was scary.
         Even though my mom told us lot of scary stories she was always there to hold us in her arms and let us know that the story was not true and that it was we were OK.
         Out of all of my sisters and brothers I was the laziest one of all, as far as working around the house.
         All of my sisters learned to cook by the age of eight.
         I learned after I got married
         so I was a pretty lazy child when it came down to cleaning up and cooking.
         So one night my mother asked me to go inside and wash the dishes.
         Naturally, I start crying, and one of my main ways of getting out of work was always saying something hurt me, either my stomach, or that I had a headache, or something was wrong with my leg.
         Just anything to get out of doing my job.
         So after she noticed that I was going to be just a little stubborn and not follow, do what she tell told me to do, she asked me to come around in the living room with her and the rest of the family.
         So she began to tell this story.
         Once upon a time there was this little girl and her family.
         And the mother asked the little girl to please go in and wash the dishes so that she could go to bed early and not come up, wake up in the morning and see all those dishes on the table.
         And her little girl just complained, "I don't want to wash the dishes.
         I don't want to.
         My leg hurts, my head hurts.
         I don't feel good."
         The little girl disappointed her mother so badly, but her mother said, "How in the world am I ever going to get her to wash these dishes?"
         So she said, "Little girl, little girl, if you don't go in there and wash those dishes like I asked, you something really, really bad is going to happen to you."
         So the little girl just said, "OK I'll go in there and wash the dishes."
         And she was in there stomping and crying and mad and taking all her good time.
         All of a sudden the butcher knife came out of the drawer and it began to roll around in the air.
         And before you know it, the butcher knife came around and cut the little girl's head off.
         And when the little girl went to heaven she was crying down to her dad and saying "Daddy, Daddy!
         Mama cut my head off with the butcher knife."
         Now that knife, when I went to sleep it really scared me.
         But the wonderful thing about it my mom was always there close by to let me know that I was OK.
         Now after that, my mother continued to tell us many, many scary stories and tell us many, many, many poems.
         I'd like to tell you about how I got into becoming a teacher's assistant.
         All my life I always wanted to be a teacher even from the time I started to school.
         That was my dream, to teach school.
         As I told you, in the past we were a very poor family and I never got the chance to go to college because of this.
         Uh, while I was in high school a teacher of mine noticed that I had an extra bone in my foot and she said, "Well now Sandra we can use this as get toward, on your grant to go to college."
         So she said, "Go home and talk to your mother about it and see if we, you know, can follow through with applying for a grant, scholarship grant for you."
         So that night I went home and I asked my mother about it and she said, "Baby, I really want you to go to college.
         It's always been my dream that my children all go to school.
         But because there are so many children in the family there are other things you're going to have to have to go to school and I just don't have the money."
         At that time my dad was in prison at the time, so it made it really hard for my mom.
         I sat there and I cried but I tried to be as understanding as possible because I knew my mother struggled really hard to even keep food on the table for us.
         So I never got a chance to go to school.
      
      
         Did anybody?
      
      
         Yes, my brother went to school.
         He went to Livingstone and then to transferred to Johnson C. Smith, so to make it easier on my mom, to, as far as, you know, him staying at home and going to school too.
         So he graduated from, um, Johnson C. Smith, here in Charlotte.
         I had another sister who went to Gaston College where she got a business degree there.
         I, in later years, I went on to college some but I didn't complete the, uh, whole four years.
         Um, I remember once, when I was working in a mill, and I was spinning yarn, and I was saying to myself, and, I was praying actually, and I said, "God, one day I want to work in the school system.
         If I could just work, even as a teacher assistant I would be happy."
         As the years went by my prayer was answered and I got the chance to work in the cafeteria as a cashier and the principal there came up to me and said, "Have you considered being a teacher assistant?"
         I said, "I would love to."
         So they told me about some classes that I could take at Central Piedmont.
         I'd never gone to college before.
         I was really afraid.
         But he told me to go ahead and try it, so I took the entrance test, and they accepted me into at the school, and I took some courses there.
         After a while, the principal said, "I would like for you to bring me your, um, transcript so I can see what your grades are like."
         Luckily I had all A's.
         I did very well.
         And he asked me to be a teacher assistant the next following year.
         Um, my dream, my prayers were answered.
         I enjoy my job very much.
         I can't think of any job that would make me any happier.
         A few years later, um, I had the opportunity to apply for a scholarship to further my education.
         At first I didn't want to apply for it, but the principal called me during the summer months and said, "Sandra the time is running out, you need to apply."
         And he told me I would have to write this paper.
         Well I didn't like writing at the time
         but I took it upon myself to go ahead and write a paper.
         And I went to, um, one of my staff members and I asked her if she would proofread it, and she thought it was an excellent paper.
         And I went ahead and mailed it in thinking uh I won't get the scholarship.
         Who cares?
         I don't, just so I can work in the school I'll be happy.
         But one day I came in and I looked at my mail and I was accepted.
         
         I couldn't believe it.
         Out of 150 assistants who had applied for this grant only 16 got the opportunity, so I felt very proud of myself.
         So I went on and took the courses, and as I started I think I was taking economics.
         I think that was the last class I took.
         My husband became very ill with cancer and I had to make a decision as to whether I would continue my education or take care of him and I felt like I needed to take care of him because he stood by me so much while I was going to school.
      
      
         But you would have been able to be a, a teacher if you had continued?
      
      
         Yeah, and at the time, I was also working in the classroom.
         I guess you'd say as a sub because the teacher that I was working with at that time was pregnant and she had to take a leave of absence.
         And they hired a sub but the sub didn't do that much.
         I had to take over the classroom.
         So I worked maybe like four months in the classroom and that highly put a damper on my wanting
         to be a teacher from all the responsibility along with the fact that I was taking care of a very sick husband.
         After all of this was, after I, I decided not to continue I've never pursued the fact of going back to school.
         I just got to a certain age and I said, "No I can't do this anymore," so I never went back.
         But I love what I do and, uh, anytime I get a chance to teach in a classroom I go for it so.
      
      
         How many different schools did you teach at?
      
      
         I've only worked at two, two schools.
         The first school I worked at was Enderly Park and then it was closed down.
         So I was in those situations where I first, come first, transfer last, come first to transfer out.
         So I had to, I was offered a job at Ashley Park or Berryhill and I chose Berryhill.
         I didn't particularly want to come here and when I came here everybody noticed that I was really, really sad because I loved being at Enderly Park.
         But then, after awhile, I fell in love with Berryhill.
         If I'm not mistaken I think I've been at Berryhill for I think 17 years, 17, 18 years I've been here at Berryhill so and I hope I never have to leave until I retire.
         
      
      
         And why did the other school close down?
      
      
         Um, the, you know, I really don't know.
         Um, that, I really don't know why they closed that school down because it was a really nice school and everything, but they eventually tore it down because I was there I think the first year I went there was the year they built a really nice gym, and I don't think they used that gym no more than three years.
         I really don't, I don't remember why that school was ever closed but it was.
         And I enjoy what I do.
         That's it.
      
      
         All right thank you.
      
      
         Thank you.
      
   

   
   
      
         My name is Bonnie Rindner and I was born in San Antonio, TX, and the story I'm going to tell is about my mother.
         Um, a little background first.
         Her, let's see, her mother's family were wealthy people at one time.
         They owned car dealerships and extensive land.
         Um, I don't know if they were farmers or not, but I know they were land owners, um, many acres and, um, her grandmother was raised in wealth.
         Uh, then the Depression came and apparently everyone lost all their money.
         Um, she was raised in MO, and she married a man, this is my grandmother I'm talking about.
         And they were very poor by this point, and they had, I think, seven children.
         And one particular Christmas, things were very, very difficult.
         There was no money to buy any presents at all, um, for the children, and my grandfather, who was killed when my mother was 16, this was, of course, way before that, um, he must have been a very positive person because what he did with the situation was he, he told the children that there were no presents this Christmas because they had given them all to Santa to take the poor children and this made the children feel happy and proud of themselves and it gave them a good feeling that they had done something very nice for someone less fortunate than themselves.
         Um, I felt like that was a way to face that situation with such hope and with joy and with love.
         And although I never met my grandfather, I have never forgotten that story and when I hear of him I think what a wonderful, wonderful person he must have been.
      
      
         And how long have you lived in Charlotte?
      
      
         Oh, I have lived in Charlotte, um, for a year.
         Um, I lived in Charlotte for five years.
         We came here in 1986, we lived here for five years, then we moved to Raleigh for seven years and now we've been back one year.
      
      
         Well, good.
      
   

   
   
      
         OK.
         Are you ready?
      
      
         Ready.
      
      
         All right.
         This is the story of Robin Hood.
         Robin Hood is, uh, or was, way back when, the home of my mother, as she grew up in Alma, Michigan.
         Um, it was a community that was put together by Englishmen, um, they were all farms, and each one had a name, like Robin Hood or something to do with England.
         Uh, there was some land, that would have been so many acres per house, and Robin Hood, um, had fond memories for my mother
         .
         But the story I want to tell happens more, um, as I was a little girl, so it was many years later.
         I was born in 1936.
         Uh, we were at my grandfather's farm, which was a different farm at that time, but it's still in the same Alma, Michigan, uh, area.
         And my aunts were all visiting; my uncles, and the cousins were there also.
         And one of the aunts, or my mother, said, "Let's go see Robin Hood."
         Well, Robin Hood had been, they moved many years ago from there, uh, so we all piled into the car and went to see Robin Hood.
         As we drove up to Robin Hood, you could tell it was left to the elements.
         There was grass, waving in the breeze and it was rather sad, no paint on the house, but you could see it had been a beautiful home at one time.
         We went up the back porch uh, the well was open, anyone could've fallen into the well, it was in the back porch, or the side porch.
         Went in, and, uh, it always, mother had always talked about the staircase and how beautiful it was, and indeed it probably had been.
         As we walked up the stairs, the window was broken and the shade was flapping in the breeze, and the wallpaper was wet from the rain, and the elements had been coming in for years; as we walked through the home, and I have fond memories of that day, I was probably in the fifth or sixth grade, I would imagine.
         Um, we went outdoors then, went into the barn, and there was a dead calf in the barn.
         Now, whether that calf had just wandered in, or whatever I don't know.
         Uh, we ourselves lived in Grand Rapids, Michigan, so we went home, uh, from Grandpa's farm that night.
         Uh,
         and my mother sat down, probably that first week, and she wrote a poem and, uh, the poem tells a lot.
         My mother's name was, uh, Catherine Berry McGovern.
         
         The poem is titled, "The Place of my Childhood Dreams":Nearer and nearer my footsteps led me Back to the place of my childhood dreams.
         Cautiously, I opened the door; I remembered no key had been turned in the lock.
         Slowly, I entered each battered room And saw the cracked plaster, the discolored walls.
         Lastly, I ascended the old, open stairway, Once the pride of my joyful, young life.
         At the landing, I gazed out the window, And there was the woods in the distance--- The woods where we had gathered wildflowers in the spring.
         And then I remembered our mother's voice calling from somewhere, "Children, be sure to put them in water---'tis cruel to pluck them, and then let them wither and die."
         Slowly as I had entered, I walked, from the home of my childhood dreams
         .
         As if from some sacred tomb I'd walked down and out and into the bright sunny spring air.
         The birds, I could hear them singing.
         How I had loved any one of those songs.
         Our favorite rosebush was gone, I saw, And wondered if others had loved it as I. From the distance, the town hall clock was striking, the school bell was ringing, I could hear, from the small town away.
         Then suddenly, the thought came.
         The sights and the sounds of the world could go on forever, But the place of my childhood dreams could never again feel the same inside.
      
      
         It's beautiful.
      
      
         My mother, um, had a wonderful life, really.
         Uh, Robin Hood, they moved into Robin Hood as a brand new farm.
         It burned within the first month that they were there.
         It was then rebuilt, and they moved in.
         And I believe, after a time, they really couldn't afford to live there any more.
         So, they moved to another farm, and lo and behold, that house also caught on fire.
         Um, as I grew up, we lived in the city until I was in the sixth grade.
         And Mother and Dad then purchased an old farmhouse, and remodeled this farmhouse, it took al, took almost a year to remodel.
         It wa, it was a wonderful uh, farm, it had wonderful gardens, as you might tell, my mother was a gardener.
         Um, when they were still remodeling the house, it was Christmastime, and we still lived in the city, the phone rang uh, whether it did or it didn't, my father said it did.
         And we went, uh, he said that we had to go out to the farm because, uh, someone had left the light on in the barn.
         So we piled into the car, Christmas Eve, and it was snowing, so beautiful.
         Typical, as I remember, dream Christmas Eve.
         And we went out, and we drove up the driveway, and Daddy went down to the bottom, the barn, and as we opened the door, a horse whinnied.
         And it was our first horse that we had, it was, uh, a Christmas present.
         And I still can picture that with the, uh, the light, the outdoor light of the barn and the snow coming down, it was really, beautiful.
         But, uh, we lived there, we moved in the spring of `48, and uh, February, around February 10 of 1959, I got a call and the house was on fire.
         It was winter, and of course, there wasn't any water and, uh, they just had water in the tank truck, and the house was gutted out, as a result of that.
         My father was in the hospital at the time, and he died a month later.
         So my mother then left our home, and, uh, didn't have a home to go to, and built a home in the city, then, uh, was happy there, although she was lonely, I'm sure.
         And, uh, created another garden, but was never the same thing.
         There was a piano that was always in each one of those homes.
         My sister still has that piano and, uh, still has the best tune of any piano I've ever heard.
         Sorry for my crackly voice.
         It's been difficult, but I loved her
         .
         Um, when my mother passed away, she passed away in 1992 and, uh, after her funeral, we went out to the farm.
         By then it, someone else had built a house on the same spot; what had been a dirt road was then a four-lane highway.
         We pulled into the driveway, and someone was living in the house, of course, and the barn was still there.
         I mean the house that they had built on this property.
         Where there had been a formal garden to the left of the driveway was then, a woods, as time had taken its toll.
         And, um, the people were very happy to see us.
         And it was a very healing experience; we walked the property somewhat.
         We walked down to the creek and the watercress was still growing in the creek as it had as I grew up.
         Uh, it was interesting that the man was sensitive as we are, and he said that they would go to certain corners of the fields on the property that was sixty-seven acres and, you could still feel Mr. McGovern's presence.
         And, uh, I liked that
         because my father was a very sensitive man, although he came across as he was being very gruff, he was not
         .
         OK.
      
   

   
   
      
         This is Gladys Shamblin.
         She is Japanese-American.
         She has lived in the Charlotte area for 13 years, and she is going to talk about growing up Japanese-American in West Virginia.
      
      
         Um, when I grew up in West Virginia, um, it was like it was backwards compared to the Charlotte area.
         It was just, uh, the people were just so different there, a lot of coal miners and, uh, there's a lot of people on welfare.
         It was just a different place to live.
         \\ Uh.
         \\
      
      
         \\ Where were you in West Virginia?
         \\
      
      
         We were growing up in Madison, West Virginia, and prior to that Kentucky.
         We lived in Kentucky, uh briefly.
         My father was from Kentucky, and we call him "The Kentucky Redneck," and
         my mother was Japanese and when she came to the United States, she couldn't speak any English or anything.
         And, uh, so she spoke broken English, and as we were being raised we learned to interpret everything she said.
         And no matter what anyone, uh, mom would say, no matter what she would say to someone, we would understand exactly what she meant, exactly what she was saying, and they couldn't believe it.
         It was like speaking a different language.
         But, um, as we grew up, our mother taught us a lot about respect and how important it is to be good and kind to other people, be courteous, uh, be thankful for all the little things that people do for you.
         I didn't realize she had implanted that in my head all these years until I grew up and people wondered why I was being so
         nice.
         Um, they thought I had a hidden agenda but it's, it was just the way I was raised.
         Um.
         And then growing up in West Virginia and being part Japanese and the only family in that area that was Japanese, it was kind of difficult.
         Um, especially when there was just a handful of Native Americans, then there were some African Americans, just a handful of them, and then there was us.
         So we were the minority, and we were very different than other families.
         Um.
         When they would start to cover like the WWII stories at school and in history class, we would, uh, kind of shrink under our seats because, you know, everybody would start yelling "Jap."
         And, uh, we, until then we didn't feel like we were different, and then we realized after that, well, we looked Japanese although we were 100% American.
         People, people would look at us and know we were different, so they would treat us different.
         Um.
         But we would go home and my mother would always reassure us that uh, it's OK to be different.
         It's what is in your heart that matters.
         So as we grew up, I, I thought it was a curse, when I was younger, being Japanese.
         Uh, went around with, not so much a chip on my shoulder, just, uh, an inferiority complex and didn't realize until I got older that I was very much proud to be Japanese.
         And uh, got to visit Japan a couple of times, and realized that's the best thing God could have given me was to be different because I'm able to help other people go through the same situation.
         Um--
      
      
         What kind of stories did your, your mother used to tell you?
      
      
         Oh, Mom used to tell us stories, when she was 11 years old, um, when World War II did hit, she looked up, which her home was not far from Hiroshima--
      
      
         Wow.
      
      
         And, uh, she looked up and could see the bombs and everything.
         And she remembers being scared and thinking that she was going to die, and she said it was just one of the hardest times of her life.
         That, but, uh, they made it through that, and um, she really never showed any bitterness or anything towards American people, but, uh, she was always just grateful for her life.
      
      
         Huh.
      
      
         Uh.
         And then Mom raised five children, I have, had three brothers and a sister.
         And she raised us with speaking broken English, and she eventually did learn English fairly well.
         She took English as a second language just after my father died.
         Um, but she was, she never worked outside the home.
         She raised us; she said that was her job.
         Um--
      
      
         How did your parents meet?
      
      
         They met, my, my mother was going to Tokyo University in Tokyo and working part-time at a china factory, and my father had gone there to buy some china for his mother, and, uh, he met my mother and just fell head over heels in love.
         And she thought he was a crazy
         American.
         And, um, he just kept being nice to her,
         and she, her family couldn't believe she would leave them and move to the United States to be with this man,
         but she did.
         And, uh, they, they were pretty happy.
         I mean she went from being fairly wealthy, though, to being poor--
      
      
         Hum.
      
      
         And that was difficult.
         But when she started having children, she said that, that's her life.
         Her children were her life.
         So, um,
         as we got older we really appreciated that, and, uh,
         when Mom got sick, she had cancer, it was our turn to take care of her.
         So for about six months, we, my sister and I both, we just kept, we just stayed beside her bed and we took care of her and it was wonderful, it was like us giving back to Mom.
      
      
         Hum.
         Did she ever go back to Japan?
      
      
         She went back twice.
         She went back right after my father died.
         He died of a massive heart attack when he was 48, and, uh, she went back that time and stayed a couple months.
         She was able to see her mother and um, get to know her family again because it had been 22 years.
         So, uh, that was wonderful, and then she went one other time, which was her last time, uh, and stayed about a month, and she came back.
         My first trip to Japan, although it was a sad trip, it was a watershed in my life.
         It was uh, after she died of cancer, my sister and I had her cremated and we took her ashes back to be with her family.
      
      
         Hum.
      
      
         So that was my first trip to Japan.
         My second trip was um, to take my daughter when she turned 16, which was a wonderful trip, and helped her understand her grandmother's culture.
         And then we plan to take my son next year when he turns 16 just so we can, uh, show him Japan.
         And we feel like travel is one of the best things you can give your children.
         Money, clothes and all that can go away but travel is in your memories and that when I'm dead and gone I want them to remember that
         .
      
      
         You mentioned that your mom talked a lot about her older brother.
         What were some of the stories she told about him?
      
      
         Well, Mom came from a traditional Japanese family um, where the Number One son does take over after the parents get to be a certain age.
         And then when he gets to be a certain age, his son takes over.
         So it's gone that way for the past 200 years.
         And, um, right now my uncle is
         almost 90, and his son is taking care of him.
         He's a Buddhist priest.
         My mother's father was a Buddhist priest.
         So that's the kind of story she'd tell us.
         She would tell us about how the people in the community always took care of their family because they were so well respected, and they lived in a beautiful place, and people would bring them gifts because they just appreciated their presence in the community.
         And um,
         we, when Mom would tell us these stories, we would laugh.
         We would think "Oh yeah, right, you were rich."
         And then when I did go over to Japan, I did see what she was talking about and really felt guilty that we didn't believe her, totally believe her, that, that she had all this, but um, according to Japanese standards, uh, they are just very wealthy.
         And then they come here and they look at my house
         and they, no really, land over there is so very expensive so they are very wealthy, and then they come here, and I live in a very basic house, and they think I'm rich, so uh, that's kind of comical
         which we're not, we're very middle class
         .
      
      
         That was a drastic change for her--
      
      
         It was.
      
      
         I mean, to go from there to, wow--
      
      
         She was pretty much treated like a princess, pretty much, I mean they catered to her family, they adopted children--
      
      
         Wow.
         What did your dad do in West Virginia?
      
      
         Actually, my father was, um, supervisor for the telephone company--
      
      
         Hum.
      
      
         Which is, I guess, why I love being around telephones and fixing phones, and I love what I do now.
         I guess it's almost to honor him.
      
      
         Why was he in Japan?
      
      
         Uh, he was in the uh, Korean War.
      
      
         OK
      
      
         Yeah, and that's where he learned all his telephone skills.
         He, uh, learned a lot in the Army, and then I think I'm the only one that kind of pursued an interest in telephones and communications and such--
      
      
         That is interesting that it would come back around that way.
         Um, was there anything else your family used to do or talked about that you wanted to include?
      
      
         Um, we used to camp, which was very unusual for my mother
         .
      
      
         Oh, I bet.
      
      
         I mean she was kind of comical.
         She was "Miss Prissy" out there, trying to camp
         .
         We used to, uh, we used to try to act like a normal
         American family, but we would have rice at the campground
         .
         I never remembered a day in my life that I didn't have rice.
         We always ate rice.
         If you got sick, she would ball up little balls of rice and, you know, "Just eat this you'll be OK."
         So she thought it, rice was a cure-all.
         But uh--
      
      
         Do you eat rice now?
      
      
         Yes, I have a rice cooker, and I pretty much keep rice on all the time.
         And my husband has learned to like it, and my children love it.
         And my daughter is pursuing a career in uh, political science and Asian studies--
      
      
         Huh?
      
      
         So she can go over there and teach English in Japan.
         And her junior year in college, she is at Furman University, her junior year she plans to go over there and spend the whole year, studying in Japan.
         So I really feel like she's doing everything I wished I could have done
         .
      
      
         Um huh.
         Is there anything else you want to include?
      
      
         No, not really but I appreciate it.
      
   

   
   
      
         You can just answer them and feel free to respond however you want to, OK?
         What stories or books do you remember reading as a little person?
         Little boy?
      
      
         My two favorite books as a child was Curious George and The Jungle Book.
      
      
         Curious George.
         That was the little red monkey with the black and white-?
      
      
         Yes.
      
      
         Did you have that doll?
      
      
         No.
         I didn't have the doll; I just had the books.
      
      
         Who told, did, did, is that story your mom read to you or did you like-?
      
      
         My mom started reading it to me when I was small and, and I picked it up on my own reading and I enjoyed the illustrations as much as the book.
      
      
         So you liked the pictures?
      
      
         Yes.
      
      
         Were they bright books?
         Or did they have bright pictures?
      
      
         They all had yellow covers and they were all paperbacks.
         And they had just little, uh, cartoons.
         Not vivid pictures, just-
      
      
         They weren't real bright colors, were they?
         And the whole page wasn't colored.
      
      
         No.
         It was just individual pictures of the monkey himself and his immediate surroundings.
      
      
         
         The monkey, I didn't like Curious George.
         That's neat!
         All right, um, well, what about that book that your mama bought you that time that, she told briefly that story.
         That book that she bought called In One Light.
      
      
         That's why I have such fond memories of The Jungle Book.
         Because she purchased a book for me and my brother and, um, it was a publishing company that could add your names and your friend's names and family names into the, into the plot of the story.
         So you became a character.
         And it really brought home, um, events of the book to you because it was personal and it was, it was, individualistic.
      
      
         Who were you?
         Do you remember what character you played?
      
      
         I was just one of the jungle boys-
      
      
         
            
         
      
      
         -who went through and had interaction with each of the members of The Jungle Book.
         There was the snake and the lion and the elephant.
      
      
         I remember The Jungle Book but do you remember the book Little Black Sambo?
      
      
         No I don't.
      
      
         OK.
         That was a story that I have fond memories of.
         Who would you consider the best storyteller in your family?
      
      
         The best storyteller would be my grandfather, my mother's father.
      
      
         Lemmie.
      
      
         Lemmie.
         Because he, he grew up, um, one of six children, and so that just adds to his storytelling and imagination and his, he's always had interaction with people so that just adds to how he interacts with people now.
      
      
         Do you remember any one particular story that he told?
         You can't think of a story?
      
      
         Not, um, right off.
      
      
         I know the story he tells about, well he's always telling about going to play music and how they'd play when he was young.
         So can you think of a story?
      
      
         I can remember a story that really is humorous in a way because he always tells a story about how he used to double date with his future wife, and my mother, which is his daughter and my dad because, unfortunately his wife passed away when, when she was really young so-
      
      
         So Eileen and him double dated with your mom and dad?
      
      
         Right.
         He would talk about how he would ask, um, he would always try to get my dad to end up paying for all four of them's dinner.
      
      
         
            
         
      
      
         And how they used to ride around together some.
         That, that to me is just something.
         It's hard to imagine your, your grandparents double dating with your parents, but, you know, that was a unique situation.
      
      
         
         So he's always been tight?
      
      
         Right.
      
      
         Um, how does he tell, when he tells those stories, like does he usually tell them at family gatherings?
         How does he do it?
      
      
         Most of the time it's during family gatherings.
         He's always got a story to tell, regardless if he sees you or if it's a family gathering.
         He's got, you know, he's going to be the one that's got, the one who is keeping the crowd up, or, or, you know, just being himself.
      
      
         
         What about you?
         What do you, when we, you and I, since we are husband and wife, when we have kids, do you imagine yourself as that kind of person?
         Like that kind of storyteller?
         Like Grandpa George and Lemmie?
         Do you see yourself like that?
      
      
         Probably, I don't know, some, to a degree.
         Um, he's probably the one person in my family who's like that.
         The rest of my family is pretty laid back and goes with the flow.
         So I think I'd probably be a little bit of him, yet a little bit of everybody else, and I'm not really one to steal the, steal the show at gatherings or what have you.
      
      
         If you were going to tell a story to your kids about your childhood, what story would you tell?
      
      
         It would probably all be sports related stories, um, because sports to me has been such a big factor in my life whether it teaches you the value of competition or the value of sportsmanship or the learning from mistakes of, um, in sports you are sometimes forced to make quick decisions and sometimes those decisions are not necessarily the right ones.
         You may end up being thrown out of a game for something stupid you do.
      
      
         Well, I think maybe you are, ah, trying to preface some story about getting thrown out of a game.
      
      
         Well, um, there have been times when me and my friends have gotten into a little bit of trouble.
         But we'd play our archrivals in a summer league baseball game.
      
      
         Who was your archrival?
      
      
         The team from the northern part of our county, North Stokes and we were the southern part, South Stokes.
         And, uh, they had one pitcher in particular who didn't like us and he was scheduled to pitch that night and after I had been hit the third time and my best friend had been hit the second time, we kind of decided that we were going take it upon ourselves to hit back.
         Only not with baseballs but with fists, so we charged the mound.
         Um, so, you know, things like that are learning experiences where you learn to grow up and mature.
      
      
         So what you going to tell your kid if someone from away hits them three times with a baseball?
         Charge the mound?
      
      
         I've been there and I know what isn't necessarily the right decision.
      
      
         What about, what is your worst memory, not your worst as in bad, but just the worst kind of memorable memory you have about playing sports all through your life?
      
      
         Well, the good thing about sports is you can remember one thing that occurs or it, or it can be a collection of memories.
         And a lot what I have are a collection of memories because when you play for 21 years of your life in sports like I have, um, really what stands out is just year to year.
         So many things can happen over the course of a year that, or over the course of that many years
         nothing stands out in particular it is just bunch of fond
         memories.
      
      
         OK, we have a phone call.
         We have an interruption.
      
      
         OK, sorry about that.
         Uh, back to the sports thing.
         You were talking about how you just had a collection of memories.
         Well if you had, how do you think you got started in sports?
         What was your family's connection to you in sports?
         Like Jeff, your brother, and Denise, and your dad and mom?
      
      
         Well, the funny thing is my parents were both athletic in high school.
         My dad played baseball in school and my mom was the star basketball player.
      
      
         Yeah, with her hook shot.
      
      
         With her patented jump hook shot.
         But, when it came to my older brother and older sister, neither one of them part-, participated in sports.
         And I wasn't, um, pushed by either one of my parents to play sports.
         It was just the kind of thing where, um, in kindergarten or even before kindergarten, it just, it just came to me that I wanted to play tee ball and from there it started.
         And after that, I asked to put up a hoop in our backyard and luckily I had plenty of, of children my age to play with and that used to be the ritual: have the neighborhood kids come over to my hoop and we'd play basketball and it ended up I was playing with a lot of older kids and so I developed an athletic ability through playing with the neighborhood kids in basketball and just starting so early and continuing on in baseball.
         So it's kind of just evolved.
         It wasn't something that was, you know, forced upon me.
      
      
         So Jeff or Denise neither one, you don't have any memories of playing with them in the yard?
      
      
         I would play with them in the yard, but they never played any organized sports.
         My sister is quite older than I am so, she and I, as far as playing sports together, you know, that was few and far between.
      
      
         She was dating when you were playing sports?
      
      
         Right.
         But my brother and I would play basketball in the yard or play baseball, and we used to play a lot of kickball in our yard, because we had a big yard and a lot of kids, so we were always coming up with something.
      
      
         What about, hmm, your daddy?
      
      
         My dad would always play too, um, he was always just one of the kids.
         Um, because we had, you know, when I was 10 or 12, we'd play against kids who were 14, 16 and my brother was about seven years older and he would come out and play, and so it was just kind of natural for my dad to fit in and play along.
         And, uh, he was always good too, and he was one of the reasons, he made me good in what I was doing because he would challenge me.
         Of course he was about 6'2" when I was growing up at 10 or 12 years old, so, he, he would challenge me to get better.
      
      
         Did he let you win?
      
      
         Sometimes, but not usually.
      
      
         Um, what's the best memory you have with your daddy and sports, because I know your daddy's- MS: Well-
      
      
         -important to you.
      
      
         Well, they always say that some of the bad things are what stands out and not necessarily a bad thing but it is one of my best memories is, ah.
         Well my dad was diagnosed with cancer right before baseball season my senior year and it didn't keep him from coming to any of the baseball games though.
         I can remember him just in, in the months prior, just prior to when he died, it was like it took every ounce of energy he had to show up at the baseball games, but nothing kept him from showing up.
         Like I said, you don't remember one thing in particular, you remember things collectively and I remember that season collectively and him making that effort to show up at the games.
      
      
         So, it meant a lot to you that he did that for you?
      
      
         Absolutely.
      
      
         He always videoed all your games too, didn't he?
      
      
         As many as he could.
         That last year I don't have any of those because he wasn't able to do it, but all of my baseball and basketball games prior to that he wanted to videotape them for-.
         It kind of started out in a funny way.
         It started out as, "Well, if I videotape them and we take them home and watch them you can watch each tape and you can analyze what you need to do to get better.
         And you can also show those to your coach and, you know, he can view the team and see what they need to do to get better."
         But, you know, it just turned into something that I will always have, those collection of tapes, such memories.
         Both hearing his voice on them, screaming at the refs or screaming at me, cheering, and what have you.
         So, it's, it's become something that been unique as a collection of tapes.
      
      
         You said your daddy played baseball and that was the sport you were best in.
      
      
         Yeah, probably.
         I mean, relative to everybody else I was good in basketball but, you know, that can't really compare to Jerry Stackhouse or anybody like that.
      
      
         
      
      
         When you add six inches to me it makes it a little bit tougher for me to compete.
      
      
         But you are good at baseball?
      
      
         Um, I was decent I guess.
      
      
         So is that going to be the sport you push on our kid?
      
      
         I'm probably not going to push any sport on our kid, my kid, although I have always said when I was in college and, right after I gave up my sports career, I always said my kid, I'm going to teach him more and work with him all the time.
         But as I've grown older and matured I've decided I'm going to let my kid be who he wants to be.
      
      
         So if we have a-
      
      
         Or she!
      
      
         Or a she, exactly.
         Um, well, hmm, since, you know, this, I'm interviewing you, and you are my husband.
         I want you to tell me the fondest story you have of me and you together.
         Something that we have done.
      
      
         Well, it's kind of a, of a defiance story probably .
         One of the stories I remember most.
         Your dad's always been real, or kind of protective of you.
      
      
         Yeah!
      
      
         Especially when we first started dating and you didn't necessarily have the most reliable car of the people in NC.
      
      
         
      
      
         Your little wrecked `84 Honda Accord wasn't necessarily the thing you were going to drive two hours away, especially two hours to come and see me.
         But, um, one of the things I remember was you putting it, putting yourself getting in trouble, and really probably wasn't one of the wisest things we have ever done.
         Putting your personal safety on the line when you took off two hours up to my house against your parent's knowing.
         I guess your mom may have known but your dad didn't know.
      
      
         Yeah, I think I told my mom.
      
      
         And, uh, and we had a nice dinner and we went out to a movie and-
      
      
         What movie did we see?
      
      
         I don't even remember the movie.
      
      
         I think it was Pelican Brief.
      
      
         I just remember you coming up and that was one of the best times we have had.
         And of course one of the things I remember most was going out to the Farmhouse which was our first official, unofficial date.
      
      
         
      
      
         
         And by our first official, unofficial date, should I go into that, too?
      
      
         Yeah.
         You can tell that.
      
      
         OK.
         Well, we ah, I had just broken up with my girlfriend of, on and off girlfriend of two and a half to three years, and you were supposedly dating a guy in the Navy-
      
      
         
      
      
         -stationed in San Diego.
      
      
         ( )
         kind of a long distance relationship!
      
      
         And my, um, fraternity was having a cocktail and I, of course, needed someone to go with since I didn't have a, uh, girlfriend at the time.
         And all my friends said, "Why don't you ask Kristi?
         Why don't you ask Kristi?"
         Because we had a bunch of mutual friends in the fraternity and-
      
      
         Which one pushed you the most?
      
      
         Morgan Collini.
      
      
         Hum!
         Morgy!
      
      
         And, um, so we ended up going out but I didn't have any idea that you did have a boyfriend!
      
      
         But I told them to tell!
      
      
         Nobody told me.
         And so I was looking at it as a date, whereas she was looking at it as a, a night out just to get out and do things.
         I don't know, I don't remember if you ended up telling me at some point during the night if you had a boyfriend, um, but it really didn't slow me down any.
      
      
         
      
      
         I kept hitting on you, kept trying to charm you.
         I guess it got to you a little bit, because we ended up eventually-
      
      
         Eventually!
         Yeah I told you I had a boyfriend on the couch remember?
         You listened to the Christmas music too much maybe a little bit too much.
         Um, tell me, uh, about your Grandpa Willis because I don't know him that much.
         Tell me something about him.
      
      
         He was one of the most reserved people you will ever meet and ah, he was 84 when he passed away and he was about 5'10" and he never weighed over a hundred thirty-five pounds.
      
      
         You take after him.
      
      
         He grew up as a farmer, a tobacco farmer, and the thing about it is that he smoked non-filtered Camels since the time he was 15 years old and he passed away at the age of 85 with the cleanest lungs, but I'm sure it didn't make the rest of his body too healthy.
         But, um, but he was just an average hard working rural American.
         With one child and he loved his one child dearly.
      
      
         That's your daddy?
      
      
         When my dad passed away in 1992 it wasn't long after that he deteriorated.
         Um, pretty much to nothing because he, ah he had lost a major part of his life and it really brought him down but he didn't necessarily, he wasn't one of the most talkative people.
         If you talked to him, it was like pulling teeth sometimes, but he would do anything in the world for you.
         Um, he would always go the extra mile, he just didn't do it with words, he did it with actions.
      
      
         Did you ever remember him playing, was he a sports guy?
         Did he play sports with you or anything?
      
      
         Not really, hmm, he grew up on a farm and, you know, playing sports was, um, and he was so much older that I was, he wasn't really in the best of health when I was growing up.
         Um, of course, we would go up there every Sunday for Sunday lunch and, uh, he would get out in the yard with us and watch us climb trees and throw rocks and play, but he never really participated because he was 70 years older, you know, 70 years older than I was.
      
      
         So your grandpa was fairly old when you were born?
      
      
         Right.
      
      
         I didn't know that.
         I didn't know your grandpa was a tobacco farmer.
      
      
         Both of my grandparents were tobacco farmers.
         It's the main economy in Stokes County, is farming.
         So there's no big towns whatsoever in Stokes County.
      
      
         I know that you used to do that when you were little didn't you?
      
      
         Yeah.
         All of my neighbors and family members grew up on farms and, and as a child in the summer when you weren't playing sports, you were farming or working in tobacco to make money.
      
      
         What did you do?
      
      
         You primed the leaves, you'd chop it, and you'd plant it.
         You know, all the things necessary to raise the crop.
      
      
         And then did you sell it?
         I mean, is that what your grandpa did?
      
      
         Then the owners would take it to the, to the tobacco warehouse and then they would auction it off and sell it per pound.
         And that's what their, uh, that's what their way of living was, was to sell that tobacco.
      
      
         Hmm, that's all your grandpas ever did?
      
      
         Well, that's what they did until they became 55 or 60 years old, and then my late grandfather Lemmie went to work in a textile mill as a supervisor and my grandfather Willis went to work in a furniture factory.
      
      
         Industry-
      
      
         Industry.
      
      
         Industry, industry came in there.
         Um, what about your, um,
         childhood with your brother and sister?
         What is the funniest story that you remember with your brother and sister as a child?
         I've heard a couple, but-
      
      
         My sister was always the little tyrant.
         She is 11 years older than me and my brother is 7 years older than me.
         And during the summer when we were home from school, and I was five or six years old when they were both still home.
         She was responsible for making sure the house got clean and the chores got done and to make sure we played a part in that, and of course she was going to make sure we did our part.
         So she was the biggest slave driver I've ever seen, and my brother was always the rebel, and I, you know, as a five or six year old, I did what I could and she didn't really have a lot of trouble with me, but with my brother being, when she was 16 he was 12 so you can imagine what kind of battles they had.
         She always had this thing about when we rebelled she would lock us in two separate bedrooms.
      
      
         
            
         
      
      
         Well, my brother's idea of rebelling was to escape out the window and run around.
         And one day, what he did was, we got locked into the room.
         I don't know what we did necessarily that day, but he climbed out the window and was running around.
      
      
         Which bedroom was he locked into?
      
      
         He was locked into the front bedroom.
      
      
         And you were locked into the-
      
      
         I was locked into the back.
      
      
         Which back?
         Your back?
      
      
         Well, that doesn't really mean anything to anybody who's listening.
      
      
         Well, it does!
         Me!
      
      
         But anyway, he climbed out a window and came by my window, and my window was several feet off the ground so it wasn't like I could escape.
         But he would throw rocks up to get my attention and he saw me look out the window and he was jumping up and down waving his arms and laughing because he was out and I was still in.
         Well, about that time he, he jumped on a honeybee.
      
      
         
            
         
      
      
         And, and the first thing I saw him do was hit the ground holding his feet so he kind of got what he deserved that day!
      
      
         
            
         
      
      
         Um, showing off a little bit, hmm, base, but they had their share of fights.
      
      
         Did he get caught?
      
      
         Yeah he got caught!
         And got locked back in with a, with a sore foot.
      
      
         Well, you were perfect, you never did anything?
         What about the hole in the wall?
      
      
         Well that's a different story!
         
      
      
         Huh!
         Yeah, that's what I thought!
         All right, uh, what about, um, your mom?
         Tell me some funny stories about your mom.
         She doesn't really tell many stories about her childhood or anything.
      
      
         My mom's got plenty of stories to tell I am sure.
         The funny, I think one of the most humorous things about her if you know my mom, she's, uh, 56 now and to imagine her with this patented hook shot on the basketball team and uh, the all-star of the, of the Stokes County Basketball League as a senior in high school is pretty funny!
         And she used to demonstrate that for me, too.
         We would go out and we would play horse and she would kick my butt because she had that hook shot that nobody else could do!
      
      
         
         In her high heel shoes!
      
      
         In her high heel shoes!
      
      
         Um, well OK.
         I guess that is probably about enough.
         Anything else that you want to add to your interview?
         OK thank you and now you are always on tape!
      
   

   
   
      
         OK.
         Have you lived in Charlotte your whole life?
      
      
         Yes, I have.
      
      
         Is there anything you want to talk about in relate-, relating to Charlotte or any particular stories you would like to share?
      
      
         Um, well, when I was about 15 I had to move from one part of Charlotte to another and it was a very hard experience for me because, um, my mother had, was remarried, um, because my father had died a few years prior to this.
         So, um, my family life was already kind of disrupted, so being pulled away from all my friends, um, really tore part of my life up because I was leaving, you know, the best group of friends that I'd even known and I'd grown up with them from like elementary school to high school.
         And, um, so I was really upset.
         I was angry with my mom.
         We didn't speak.
         She sent me to like a frigging shrink to, um, help maybe, you know, sort through my emotions or whatever.
      
      
         OK.
      
      
         Um, so, uh, but what, but actually, my move was probably one of the best things that ever happened to me, oddly enough, um,
         because when I moved, um, I met like, you know, close friends that, actually, now I go to college with and who I was a roommate with for a year or so.
         Um, so even though it was kind of a scary experience being uprooted from everything you knew, um, it gave me the chance to see that change is good and that, um, seeing a different part of, you know, just different parts of the same town, it's still very beneficial because it gave me the chance to realize how to adapt to different situations, into a different environment, relatively quickly.
         Um, because I ended up making a lot of good friends and, um, really loving the part of town that I moved to and really adapting to, um, my community there, um, and getting involved.
         And actually, the friends that I made there are the ones I ended up going to college with and not the ones from my first high school.
      
      
         Right.
      
      
         So, um-
      
      
         Do you feel it made it easier for you to adapt to college life because of the move?
      
      
         Definitely.
         Because I was already, in one sense, ready to for another change.
         Whereas a lot of my friends had never even been in a different situation, in a different group of friends from the ones they had known from elementary school.
         They couldn't imagine being uprooted and not seeing the same faces every day.
         Whereas I'd already had this type of thing in my life, so I was more, I think I was quicker to adapt to a different college surroundings.
      
      
         Uh-huh.
         Do you feel that it was hard being the new person in school?
         I mean were people really, did they I don't know how to put it.
      
      
         They didn't like me
         at first `cause I was the new girl and where, you know, most of the guys, if a new girl comes in, of course they're going to be friendly just because
         it's new blood or whatever.
      
      
         Right.
      
      
         But the girls did not want to have anything to do with me, they're catty.
         It was like I was, you know, invading their territory or whatever.
         Um, so it really took them, probably, I'd say, at least three months before I'd actually consider them my friends because I'd have classes with, um, Stephanie, who is one of my good friends now, but she did not talk to me for the first three months.
         I mean, and she even admitted that she didn't like me because I was new.
         Even though I don't think it was because of anything I'd done because I had hardly said two words since I didn't know anybody, but, um, they were real coy towards me, you know.
         But it-
      
      
         Why do you think that is?
         Why do you thing do you think that's just girls in general?
      
      
         Actually, I think it is most girls in general.
         It's just a natural thing if you, if you have certain guy friends that you become very possessive over and you see someone, whether it's their new girlfriend or their new best friend or whatever, comes in and takes up some of your time, I think it's just human nature to get jealous and to kind of put up a, you know, an offensive front to whoever the invader or the intruder is.
         So, I think I've probably done the some time in my life, so I don't have any hard feelings towards them.
      
      
         And you feel it was a good thing, overall, the whole experience of moving and being the new kid and-?
      
      
         Absolutely!
         I wouldn't trade that experience for the world because there are too many people that I know who are very sheltered from not only new experiences, from like new ideas and new situations, and so I think it's kind of a blessing that I had the chance to go through this in the kind of, um, be the new kid and see what it was like to be the outsider and to not be in the in crowd, you know.
         Because, I mean, I think a lot of people who have never been on the outside don't understand what it's like to be kind of the kid that's, you know, not "Mr. Popularity," you know?
         Who doesn't have all the friends and who doesn't get all the attention, and so it was nice because, you know, in school, like, I had a good circle of friends I was always, you know, an athlete, or whatever, so, you know, I received the attention.
         But for those few months that I was the outsider, I really got to see what it was like, you know, to not be, you know, cool, or whatever.
      
      
         Uh-huh.
         Now I understand.
         Is there anything else you'd like to say or?
      
      
         Umm, other than it was a good experience, that's about it.
      
      
         Well thank you so very much for sharing your experience with us.
      
      
         You're very welcome.
      
   

   
   
      
         Hi, how are you?
      
      
         Fine.
      
      
         What's your name?
      
      
         Caroline Silva.
      
      
         Caroline Silva, I'll be asking you some questions.
         Uh, what stories do you remember that your family members used to tell you?
      
      
         Um, stories about when they were little.
      
      
         Any that you remember?
      
      
         Not really because I was, I think I was too young when they told me that, I don't exactly remember.
         But, like my mother's mother, my grandmother she like told us about how when she was very young and her mother die, so she had to go and work and help her family.
      
      
         
         And from when you were little do you remember somebody telling stories, other stories?
      
      
         Um.
         
         My mom used to tell us stories at night and they were sort of like be made up stories that she like made up sort of about the day so she used me and my sister's name in it and they'd be funny, because they weren't true but they had, like I was a character in them, and so was my sister
         and we can be anything from animals to humans.
         And it sort of told about what you did during the day and how you acted.
      
      
         Did you enjoy those stories?
      
      
         I did!
      
      
         Um, do you remember at what time she used to say that?
      
      
         Well,
         before we went to bed.
         But if it was, like too late already well, we didn't listen to them, we couldn't, she didn't tell them to us, because we had to go to bed, but whenever she had time she would tell us.
      
      
         Do you remember how your bedroom used to look when you were that, that young?
      
      
         No.
      
      
         Do you remem--
      
      
         \\ But I shared it with my sister.
         I know that.
         \\
      
      
         Uh huh.
      
      
         I think we lived in an apartment.
         And.
         --
      
      
         What city?
      
      
         Miami, Florida.
      
      
         Uh huh.
         So you are from Miami?
      
      
         Yes.
         
      
      
         What about books?
         Do you remember reading books when you were young?
      
      
         Um, in kindergarten at five, my kindergarten teacher Mrs. Thorpe started teaching us how to read, and the alphabet and so we used to have these um, little books that had like a sentence or less per page and it had like a really big, big picture on every single page.
         So if you didn't understand what it said you could sort of comprehend with the picture and that got me interested in reading more.
         So I started reading bigger books little by little.
      
      
         Do you remember the names of those little books?
      
      
         Um, like some of them were like called Sam I Am.
         They didn't have more that a title, probably like three words in it.
         
      
      
         Uh hum.
         So you're saying you don't remember much about the house that you used to live?
      
      
         Yeah.
      
      
         Do you remember somebody telling you stories when you were little?
         When you were young?
      
      
         Yes.
         I don't remember exactly what the stories were but I know that like the grownups in the house, like during Christmas or reunions or whenever we saw each other, we would talk at the dinner table, and they like told about old times, and we'd laugh
         or any where; in the living room.
      
      
         But you don't remember any about yourself?
      
      
         Yes, um, like they used to tell me stories that went I was little I used to climb everywhere around the house.
         And one of them was that one time I wanted something on top of the bed that couldn't reach and so you said, my mom said to get, to find a way to get it, and so I don't remember what I grabbed, but I grabbed something and I climbed on top of the bed and I grabbed the thing that I wanted and I think they were like surprised because they didn't think that I would actually do it.
         Another one was when I think I was younger than that I was trying to climb up on a couch and my grandfather was like watching me behind me and he kept saying to everybody, "she's going to fall, she's going to fall, she's going to fall, she fell," because I did fall and everybody laughed and I think they took a picture of me when I was like climbing up the couch or whenever I was on that couch.
         But they sort of told me that from climbing all over the couches, I sort of ruined them.
      
      
         Uh oh.
         Do you like to read?
      
      
         Yes!
      
      
         What kind of readings?
      
      
         Fictional books, mainly, like about the future, that like make me think and wonder, and, you know, grab my attention.
      
      
         Will you say that you're a good reader?
      
      
         Yes.
      
      
         Why?
      
      
         Well mainly almost everybody does and I think I do read like really good.
         And like usually, like my sister comes up to me and once I'm done reading a book she'll go like, "How can you read that fast?"
         you know.
      
      
         What you mean fast?
      
      
         Well I can probably get a thick book and finish it in a day.
         It depends how long I like stay on it.
         And so,
         I mean everyone is different.
         Like she can't read that fast, but I can read that fast and understand what's in the book and don't have to read it again.
         Um, so that's what I mean by like I can read fast.
      
      
         Do you have a collection of books or do you have a lot of books at your house?
      
      
         Um, I have a certain collection that's called Animorphs.
         It's like one of those fictional type of futuristic type books and I like to collect them.
         I mean they're really easy books.
         But I like them and the author is K.A. Applegate and they're new, I mean they've been out for a while, but they're new compared to other books that have been out.
      
      
         Do you like to tell stories?
         
      
      
         Well--
         
         
      
      
         To make a story?
      
      
         Well, yeah.
         I mean, sometimes I'm in the mood for it, sometimes I'm not, but I do like it.
      
      
         You like to what?
      
      
         I do, um, like to tell stories.
      
      
         OK.
         Do you, can you describe your bedroom?
      
      
         Um.
         When you walk in the door and you look to your left you see a desk and on the same wall as the door is a closet that's um, two sliding doors that you open and then my bed is horizontal to the room against the wall were my desk is, to the left of the room.
         And then if you look straight ahead from the doorway there is this really big window by the other wall, in front.

         OK.
         Pleased.
      
   

   
   
      
         Hi how are you?
      
      
         Fine.
      
      
         What's your name?
      
      
         Ivonne Silva.
      
      
         How old are you Ivonne?
      
      
         Fourteen.
      
      
         Fourteen.
         Ivonne, I'll be asking you some questions.
         Uh, what stories do you remember family member telling you?
         Any family, family member.
      
      
         Uh, about their life, and like my grandmother used to tell me about when she lived in Colombia, South America and she used to go really early in the mornings with a group of people to church, with a group of older girls, and they would go on the bus and they would drink hot chocolate and bread every morning on Sundays.
         And then my dad told me about a time when he climbed up on the window and my grandmother came out and look at him and scared him and he fell down and rolled down the street because it was steep.
         And
         and, he talked about a time that he was trying to cut a tree or something and he cut his knee open.
      
      
         With what?
      
      
         Like an ax.
      
      
         Oh.
         
         Do you remember maybe your grandfather telling you stories?
      
      
         No.
         But I remember when my dad said he fell down and he hit his head in the, like a river because he dived in, and my grandmother dived in the same place and she hit herself there too.
      
      
         When she did that, when she was older?
      
      
         When she was young like teenager.
      
      
         And then later on in life her son did the same?
      
      
         Yeah.
         Yeah.
      
      
         In the same place?
      
      
         Yeah.
      
      
         Do you remember the name of that place?
      
      
         Poso Azul.
      
      
         Which means?
      
      
         Blue
         pond or something.
      
      
         Very good.
         Um, do you remember stories being told by other family member, maybe your mother?
      
      
         Yes.
         My mom told me stories.
         She would make up stories for us, my sister and I, at bedtime when we lived in Miami and she would tell us stories like, including like characters that were like us but we had different names and stuff, or we would be animals and they would have morals to them at the end and, or we would read books at night before going to bed.
      
      
         So this was in your bedroom?
      
      
         Yes.
      
      
         It was just your bedroom?
      
      
         Yes.
      
      
         Or somebody else's?
      
      
         No.
         Oh, oh it was my sister's and my room.
      
      
         Do you remember how it looked like?
         Can you describe it?
      
      
         Yes.
         It had a bed where you pull another bed out from under it and it had one of those
         like porch outside of it and it was a big room, and when you came in the front door to the apartment it would be down the left hallway.
         It would be the first door on the right.
      
      
         And do you remember stories about maybe somebody else in the family?
         Maybe that you can tell?
      
      
         
         Oh yeah!
         My sister when she was like four, she went into the walk-in closet in my parent's bedroom and she put baby powder all over herself and all over the clothes.
         And also in that same walk-in closet my sister and I, we would go in there and hide from my dad and when he got home from work and we would wait for him to come in and turn on the light and then when he walked in we'd scare him.
         Because we'd be hiding on the shoes and behind the clothes.
      
      
         Very good.
         Um.
         Do you like reading?
      
      
         Yes.
         I read a lot.
      
      
         What kind of books do you like to read?
      
      
         All type of books, but I have a collection.
         I collect um, Anne of Green Gables because I like it.
      
      
         Why, is there a favorite book?
         Or are those your favorite ones?
      
      
         I like those, yeah.
      
      
         
         All right, um.
         
         Do you like to tell stories?
      
      
         Yeah.
         I like writing stories and poems and I write them for school a lot and I'm part of a magazine to write stories and poems and we draw too, to put stories that students write in the magazine for school.
      
      
         Um.
         Do you have books now?
      
      
         We have a lot of books.
      
      
         At home?
      
      
         Yeah, we had a lot of different types of books and we have some books from when we were little too.
      
      
         Where do you keep them?
      
      
         Downstairs we have like a playroom is like a big TV room and we keep them down there on one half of it.
      
      
         What about your bedroom?
         Now do you share bedrooms with your sister?
      
      
         No, I have my own room and I have some books in there but not many because most of them are downstairs.
      
      
         Can you describe your bedroom?
      
      
         Yes.
         There is a bed, it's a full bed and it's got a desk and a dresser and a closet and a bunch of stuffed animals.
      
      
         \\ Oh.
         \\
      
      
         Because I like stuffed animals, and it has two windows, and when you walk in, the bed is to your left and so is the dresser and the desk is to your left and right.
         Like, like--
      
      
         What things do you have on your desk?
      
      
         Uh, I have a bunch of things.
         I have pictures of my pets and my family and I have books and I have medals and stuffed animals.

         Oh that is nice.
         OK, thank you very much.
      
      
         You're welcome.
         Bye.
      
   

   
   
      
         Patricia Smith, age 59 and I'm from Connecticut.
      
      
         What kind of stories were told to you as a child?
      
      
         We have a family picture of me and my brother and sister sitting on the couch with my mother reading us a story.
         I do not remember what the story was about.
         Um, the stories I remember the most was listening to the radio.
         Um, I don't remember stories from my mother reading them
         .
         It was a stand up big radio, we didn't have a TV at this time, and I sat leaning on the radio listening to my favorite, The Shadow, Only the Shadow Knows a mystery story every week.
         I do not remember being read to with books.
         I remember one night, though, having to walk up the street to the farmhouse to get milk.
         It was Christmastime and it was cold, and being bundled up, I walked at nighttime slowly up the street.
         There was a full moon.
         I slowly looked up at the moon and saw a gold sleigh and Santa approaching the left side of the moon.
         I was surprised and did not believe what I was seeing, so, I paused and I gazed in awe that I actually saw Santa and the sleigh!
         I couldn't get it out of my mind as I continued my walk.
         When I got home, I told everyone and don't remember any responses.
         I was told by a friend there was no Santa, that really bothered me so I asked my dad one night during the Christmas season.
         He had a way of speaking, with a strong voice that we never questioned when he used it.
         And when he, when I told him what my friend said he sat me down saying, "That is not true, there is a Santa," in that voice we never questioned.
         "Your friend is wrong and let me tell you why."
         And he just proceeded with his loving logic and questions to prove to me there really was a Santa.
         Everything he said made sense to me and I could feel myself well up inside with pride and love for my father and I felt so good and happy that my friend was now wrong and I was right and there really was a Santa, and that Santa was in my heart and mind now.
      
      
         Which one was your favorite story?
      
      
         That was my favorite story, it was the most impactful story.
         And to this day, I can still remember feeling so proud that my dad convinced me and all those feelings of believing that that was true and I can still feel that today.
      
      
         Did you read books or tell stories to your children?
      
      
         Yes, I did both.
         I read books and told stories.
      
      
         What kind of books did you read to your children?
         Where did you read them?
         Why did you read them?
      
      
         Well, uh.
         Children's books, um, like Dr. Seuss, and I did a lot of books on feelings, about being sad, happy, neat, and angry and things like that, um, so they could understand the feelings at those levels.
         And um, I got books, like transactional analysis, which they called TA for tots, and "I'm OK, You're OK," um, a gamut of fairytales, uh, like The Three Little Pigs and things like that, every, I love children's books and every children's book I could get, I brought for the kids.
         
         Um, I had many, many books for my children.
         Uh, the books were always available to them.
         I read to them at bedtime uh, in their beds, other times they sat in my lap during the day, um, like going over the pictures, the sounds and the tone of voice, uh, through me, um, as to what the character was feeling, scared, happy, angry.
         When I felt like it um, it would be effective and my children's behavior said, "They were really into this story," at that point then I would add my own words and make up more of what had caught their interest.
         Um, being each character myself as I read added, added more excitement for them and for me.
         Sometimes we'd lay on the carpet and read and I'd follow their interest, when to stop and when to start, and when sometimes, to turn the page.
         It was all up to their interest.
         Um, I read at bedtime as a calming down for all of us, being together and ending our day.
         Sitting on the couch with them, uh, gave me the feeling of closeness and the uh, children's closeness or bonding with me.
         Um, and when we read was whenever anybody wanted to read and sometimes I would introduce a new book to them and say I have a new story for you.
      
      
         OK.
         What kind of stories did you tell your children?
         Do you recall any of them?
      
      
         Oh yeah, oh yeah, I recall them.
         I made up stories, um, that I told to my children also.
         They were older and enjoyed scary, uh, scary stories at that time.
         So, I told them scary stories that chilled them.
         At bedtime, um, when all were in the same bed, and that's where they had to be for these stories.
         Um, I usually made up a story according to what they were feeling at different points in their lives.
         Their favorite was "The Wood-Monster," uh, sometimes the kids felt like running away from home and whatever I would pick up with the kids that they were issuing is what I would make a story out of and to get my point across to them too.
         Um, this, this story involved, this "Wood-Monster" story involved kids that uh felt like running away from home and this story involved kids who decided to do just that one late night.
         Um, they sneaked out of their bedroom windows and they all met and went into the woods.
         Um, as they thought this was really cool, and they were sitting under a big tree in the woods, the branches started moving, the kids thinking, uh, that the wind was doing it, but when the branches started to slowly come down and start touching them, they got scared, and the branches were trying to wrap around them, then the trunk of the tree started bending also.
         And they all started screaming, running away.
         They discovered as they ran by each tree in the woods that all the trees were alive and wanting to attach their branches around them.
         There was nowhere they could go to free themselves of this nightmare except home.
         So they finally all decided that this was not the thing and they got back into the house, uh, through their window and felt the safe, warm comfort of their beds and vowed never to do that again.
         And also certain stuffed animals my kids had were, um, were also made alive by me.
         When they got thrown on the floor and not cared about, I made up a story about how the animal felt being treated that way when it loved them so much and wanted to be snuggled up by them at night, I played the animal of course, and then with your arms around it, I still do this once and awhile with my adult children.
         One of my children was really drawn into this story and today she is very sensitive and compassionate with animals.
         Um, I also sent my young adult children Easter bunnies and the loving message that went with it, uh, was from the bunny.
         Like, this bunny talked with me at the store and he was so sweet and loving and really wanted to be with one of you, one of my kids and not left on the shelf in the store all by himself, so I would create that kind of story and attach it to the bunnies and send them to my children.
      
      
         Do you read stories now?
         And If so, what kind?
      
      
         Um, I some of them are made into stories, um, see for the past maybe 25,30 years I've read many new age books, uh, from channeling to personal stories by the authors relating to their major life changes.
         Um, I have read many self-awareness books and management books and books on raising children.
         All of my reading basically involved self-improvement at each level of my growth, um, including spiritual growth.
         I read all of these books to help me be a more effective parent, person, manager, and spiritual being.
         Um, my best reading time was in bed where I had no interruptions, um, and then I could focus on the information.
         And I still send my adult children books on topics I think they could gain deeper insight to.
         
      
      
         What's your favorite book now?
      
      
         Um, my very favorite book is God on a Harley.
         Um, it, through that book it was me going through all the same experiences as the author and I saw more clearly what I needed to do.
      
      
         OK, well thanks Pat.
      
      
         You're welcome.
      
   

   
   
      
         This is the story of how I met my husband.
         It's kind of like a Brady Bunch story.
         I was the lady with the two daughters and he was the man with the two sons.
         We had each been divorced for a while and we each were too busy to do any dating or meeting of perspective mates.
         So my daughter Michaela had a group of friends, affectionately called "The Quail Girls," and his son, Ryan, had a group of friends, I won't tell you what we'd name them, but anyway, they were normal high school seniors, and both of the children were seniors at South Mecklenburg High School at the same time.
         And the boys and girls interacted a lot, they were, uh, they were all friends.
         One of the girls in Michaela's group, Shelle, just got an inspiration one day when she was staring out a window riding down the road, and she said, "Chaela!
         We need to get your mom to meet Ryan Speckman's dad!"
         And Michaela said, "Really?"
         `Cause she was, of course, very protective of her mom.
         So finally, Michaela said, "Well maybe that will work."
         And all of the other girls are saying, "Yeah, yeah, yeah!"
         So that was when the idea was born.
         And for the next few months, Michaela kept saying, "You know, Mom, you need to meet Mr. Speckman."
         And I said, "Now why do I need to meet Mr. Speckman?"
         "Well you need to meet Mr. Speckman because he's single and all he has time for is his job and the boys.
         He's really cute and he's a really nice guy and he's real involved with the kids."
         I said, "Well if he is really cute and he's a really nice guy, then I'm sure that he's got a girlfriend."
         And she said, "No, no, no.
         I know he doesn't.
         I just know he doesn't because the girls say he doesn't and he never goes to the games with anybody, and you need to meet Mr. Speckman."
         So I said, "All right, whatever.
         I'll meet Mr. Speckman."
         So then I would forget about it and the girls would come over and they would say, "Ms. Quinn you need to meet Mr. Speckman."
         And I'm like, "Yeah, yeah, yeah.
         I'll meet Mr. Speckman."
         So, um, a soccer game would come up because the boys played soccer, the Speckman boys played soccer.
         Michaela would say, "How about it?
         Can you go to the soccer game on Thursday night?"
         And I had an evening job and I would say, "Well no I can't go Thursday."
         So then a few more games would go by, um, I could go to the game, but she couldn't go to the game and next time she could go to the game then I couldn't go to the game and she would say, "Well Mr. Speckman wasn't there anyway."
         So this fixture in our house became this Mr. Speckman person.
         So, um, there was, at the end of the sports season, the fall sport season and the spring sport season, at South Mecklenburg there was always, a what they called, a banquet and they didn't serve any food, but for some reason they called it a banquet.
         They had all the children, the students from the fall sports up on the stage to be introduced, get whatever recognition were appropriate, and, um, there was going to be one in early December of 1995.
         And, uh, that was when it was decided since I was going to be there, because Michaela played tennis in the fall, and Mr. Speckman was going to be there, since Ryan and Eric played soccer in the fall that was when this meeting would take place.
         So in order to make sure that I would be there one of the Quail Girls, who lived right around the corner from the Speckmans, said she would come and she would pick me up.
         Michaela couldn't drive me because she had to be there early to be in this program.
         So Michaela helped me pick out what I was supposed to wear and, uh, Wendy came to pick me up.
         And you have to understand, Wendy is this, she's a wonderful girl but she's kind of a silly girl.
         She's always like, "Ha, uh, ha, uh!"
         So Wendy came to pick me up and I was all nervous and everything, which was ridiculous.
         I was, I felt like a high school girl myself.
         And, um, when we got there, uh, we s, sat with Wendy's parents, who, again, live around the corner from Mr. Speckman.
         They said, this is, uh, Wendy's mother said to me, "Oh!
         You're going to meet John Speckman!
         Whew!
         I hope this works out!
         You've got good taste!"
         I'm like, "Oh boy!
         What am I getting myself into?"
         So Wendy and I sat down and were just kind, you know, of chatting.
         She's squirming and looking all around and everything and the program started and it's quiet and all of a sudden she says, "There he is!
         Right over there, right over there!"
         I said, "Sssh!"
         So anyway I got, I got a chance to take a look at Mr. Speckman and, um, he looked just like Michaela had described, so through the whole thing I kind of did an analysis of, you know, do I or do I not want to meet Mr. Speckman?
         And if I do, you know.
         Basically, do I or don't I want to meet Mr. Speckman, but I felt like I would let Michaela and all of the girls down if I did not.
         So after the program was over Michaela came down off the stage.
         And she came and, uh, came with me to the little lobby of the auditorium where they were serving food.
         So all the Quail Girls and I were together and we were having punch and cake or whatever, and the guys and Mr. Speckman were over kind of in another area.
         So, uh, you know, Wendy was saying, "How are we going to do this?
         How are we going to do this?"
         And I said, "Well, you know, if it happens, it happens.
         If it doesn't happen I'll, I'll, you know, it can happen at another time I'm sure.
         We'll be in the same place another time," because minutes went by and nothing happened.
         So I said to Michaela, after about five or 10 more minutes, "You know, maybe this isn't the right time.
         Let's just leave and, and, you know, I'll, I'll just meet him another time."
         And all of a sudden I got this tap on the shoulder and I turned around and I looked up into the eyes of this high school boy and it was Ryan Speckman.
         And he said, "Don't you want to meet him?"
         And I fell in love with Ryan Speckman first, and I said, "Well sure!"
         So he went and he got him and I walked in that direction, and Mr. Speckman came over and said, "Hi!
         You must be Ms. Quinn."
         And I said, "You must be Mr. Speckman."
         So we introduced each other and had a few awkward moments and then we left.
         So the next, th, OK that was the Monday of Thanksgiving week, so I had to work the day after Thanksgiving in the medical clinic where I worked, and it was a crazy, crazy, crazy day, and Michaela called me in the middle of the day, this was on a Friday, and she said, "Guess who called and left a message?"
         And I said, "Who?"
         And she said, "Mr. Speckman!"
         And I said, "You're kidding!"
         And she said, "Are you going to call him?
         Are you going to call him?
         Are you going to call him?"
         So I said, "Yeah I'll call him."
         So I went home that night, called him, left him a message, he wasn't there.
         So a couple of days later, I get home from work again in the evening and there was a message that said, "Call me back, whatever time."
         So I called him back and we arranged to have dinner on that following Friday.
         So I called and talked to Michaela and I said, "Well we're going out to eat."
         And she said, "I knew it!
         I knew it!
         I knew it!
         Ryan came up to me at school and he said, `He called her!
         I think they're going to go out!
         ' " And apparently another one of the Quail Girls worked at Boston Market and some of the boys who were in Ryan's group crossed the serving line and said, "He called her and he's going to ask her out!"
         So everybody knew before I knew that he called me and was going to ask me out!
         So Friday came and we were supposed to go out.
         I came home from work so there was a message and on the voice mail was Shelle, the girl who had this brainstorm to begin with, and she said, "Hi!
         This is Shelle!
         Just wanted to tell you good luck tonight.
         Don't be nervous!
         You'll be fine!"
         And I'm like, "I'm old enough to be your mother, I'm sure I'll be fine!"
         So everybody's eager to find out what's happening on this date.
         So, um, Michaela was going out and I had instructions to call her as soon as I got home, to beep her as soon as I got home so we could discuss the date.
         So we went out to dinner at a place where, Mr. Speckman had asked one of his sons' friends where we should go and he said that's where we should go, and so we went there to eat.
         And the whole evening was talk, the discussion the whole evening was how all the preparation, and all the discussion that was going on with me and the Quail Girls was also going on with John and with all Ryan's friends.
         And they had cleaned out the car, they called him at work and made sure that he was there in time for the date, so, I mean, we had a lovely evening, lovely evening.
         And, um, just talked about how funny it was that these kids were trying to, to make us meet.
         So the next day, um, Michaela, yeah, I called Michaela, and she said, "What did you think?
         What did you think?"
         I said, "You know, he's a very nice man, but he is so busy with his business and with his two boys that I don't even think he's even got time for another date but he, he is very nice.
         But if he asked me out again I'd probably go out again."
         So this was Friday night, early, so the next day I went out and I bought a Christmas tree and I had a lot of errands to do.
         In the afternoon Mr. Speckman calls and said, "Really had a good time last night."
         I said, "I did too.
         It really was fun."
         He said, "I'd like to do it again sometime."
         And I said, "Yeah I would too."
         So we're talking some more, and I said, "I went and got a Christmas tree."
         He said, "What are you going to do this evening?"
         I said, "I'll probably put the Christmas tree up."
         He said, "You know I would really like to go to McAdenville."
         So anyway, I said, "Cool!
         You want to go to McAdenville, we'll go to McAdenville."
         So Michaela came home and I said, "Guess what?
         I'm going to McAdenville."
         And she said, "Oh my God!"
         She called Shelle , Shelle was at the house in five minutes!
         "I can't believe it she's going out with him again!
         You're going out with him again!"
         So we went out again and we went out the next Friday and Saturday and the next Friday and Saturday and the next Friday and Saturday, and meanwhile, all the kids at school are in absolute shock that we liked each other and we were going out, I don't know what they expected.
         And one friend of Ryan's, Brandon said to Michaela one day, "Wouldn't it be weird if your mom and Mr. Speckman got married?
         And like, you moved into that house and you were taking a shower and Ryan, Ryan's your stepbrother and he's going to knock on the ba-, how weird would that be?"
         Michaela told me that and I said, "That is so weird."
         She said, "That is so weird!"
         Well it wasn't long before, um, probably a month or two later, she said to me, "Mom he's wonderful.
         Would you ask him to marry us?"
         Anyway, to make a long story short, about, we met in December of `95.
         February of '96, he asked me to marry, No!
         February of `97 he asked me to marry him.
         June of `97 we got married, and our wedding party was the Quinn girls and the Speckman boys, and the guest list was the Quail Girls and all of Ryan's friends and they all lived happily ever after.
      
   

   
   
      
         OK.
         My name's Carmen Stack and I'm just going to tell a little bit about myself.
         Um, I was born in Charlotte, NC and I moved to Monroe, um, which is about forty-five minutes east of Charlotte, um, when I was about three.
         And I've grown up there pretty much all my life.
         I moved back to Charlotte to go to college and stayed there for four years and am still there.
         But, um, OK, but I live with my parents right now.
         I moved back in after I graduated college and I have a sister, she lives there, too.
         She's in high school.
         Her name is Ivy and she's going to turn seventeen in a couple weeks.
         And my grandmother lives next door and my grandfather works across the street from where we live so, we're all really close and pretty tight and, um, I'm real, I'm closer with my grandmother, um, which is my mom's mother, and, um, we do a lot of stuff together, go shopping, and go to lunch, and stuff everyday.
         So, um, but anyway, I guess I can tell a story about when I was little.
         I, OK, I, um, I have a lot of cats and I have a lot of dogs and so I love animals a lot.
         And, um, when I was probably about eight years old my mom and I, um, well we had two dogs, one was a Russian Wolfhound and one was just a little mutt-dog.
         But, um, we left them there by themselves with, uh, well like a bowl of food out, which usually we don't do, but we were going to go get some lunch and, um, we were gone for probably about twenty minutes.
         And we came back and, Mongoose was the little one and Tanya was the bigger dog, uh, but when we came back, we saw that Mongoose, uh, was bleeding from her eyes.
         Tanya had ripped her eye out, had bitten her eyeball out, um obviously over the food that we had left out on the floor.
         And so, obviously I was totally devastated and my mom was, too and so we rushed her to the vet and, um, they, everything was OK.
         Like they were able to save her but they couldn't put her eye back in, so they just kind of sewed it up and eventually it grew hair back over it.
         
            And, uh, she just had one eye with hair covering the other side.
         So it was pretty, it was funny, but she lived for another six years at least.
         So, but she was a good dog.
         And, but she did fine after that with just one eye, but, um, let's see I guess-
      
      
         Do you have any memories about many trips you used to take when you were little?
         Like to the beach or something?
      
      
         Um, yeah, well, um, we, my aunt Bebe had a beach house.
         Well, they always had like a condo that they had rented, or they owned a couple, um, when I was little.
         And, this was on my mom's side, and we would always, it would be like my aunts and my cousins and my grandmother.
         My, my grandfather died before I was born.
         Uh, he died when my mom was probably about eighteen so I never got to see or meet him.
         But, um, all of us and my mom and my sister and my dad and everybody would go to the beach and, um-
      
      
         What was it Myrtle Beach?
      
      
         Yeah, we'd go to Myrtle Beach.
         And, um, we would stay for probably about a week and we just had, we all had the best time.
         We, all the cousins were just really close, like we all were probably about the same age except for my sister, she was, she's seven years younger than me so-, and everybody else is older than me.
         I have a cousin that's, um, 31 now and Tara is, Rachel's 31, Tara's 28, Michael's 24, I'm 23 and my sister is 17.
         So, but, anyway, um, we all, we all got along really good and it was just, it was like one of the better times that we all had, that we all spent together for the year.
         And when it was time to go to the beach together it was just like, it was like great!
         We couldn't ever replace it.
         So, but, uh, I guess that's the-
      
      
         What would you do when you were at the beach?
         What was your favorite place?
      
      
         Well, we would all, well our favorite place, I mean we were pretty young, so our favorite place was like the Pavilion or going to walk on the strip or something.
         But, um, we, you know, during the day it was always the beach, going to the beach and playing on the beach, and laying out and then going shopping at the, um, like Broadway at the Beach or, um, Barefoot Landing.
         And we'd usually shop during the day and then at night we'd sit, well, food is like the main thing for our family.
         We center everything around eating dinner so, or eating a dinner, breakfast, dinner, or lunch.
         So, but, um, at night we'd always go to dinner and, um, to the Pavilion or else to go to the Grand Prix or, is that what it's called?
         And, um, stuff like that.
         Like the adults would always take us places and let us go and ride rides and stuff like that and we'd all go together as a big group and it was just a lot of fun.
         We were all really close and we still are.
         But, um-
      
      
         Was it, your, your grandmother does she, she sort of, you said, she kind of heads up the whole thing?
      
      
         Oh yeah.
      
      
         Sort of the matriarch?
      
      
         Yeah, she definitely is.
         She's like, she heads everything, like-
      
      
         Is she from Charlotte?
      
      
         Yeah well, yeah.
         She's from Charlotte.
         She was born and raised in Charlotte.
         And, uh, so, you know, she had all her, she had three children.
         And, um, my grandfather was, he's from Charlotte, too and all his family.
         And, um, but yeah, my grandmother, she's like the head of everything.
         She makes sure that we're all together for Thanksgiving and Christmas and Labor Day and New Year's Day and everything.
         She just always wants everything to be at her house and kind of be centered around her.
         So after she's gone I don't really know what we're going to do.
         It'll be kind of hard for us.
         But, ah, she's 74 and she's still going strong but actually yesterday she had a small stroke but she's, she's OK.
         She's better today.
         She's been in the hospital, but, um, she, they're just kind of giving her some physical therapy and stuff right now, just to kind of make sure she'll do OK.
         But she's strong.
         She'll make it through.
      
      
         You said, uh, you were telling me, she's, uh, got some funny sayings that she says and stuff?
      
      
         
            
         
      
      
         She's got some funny, like when-.
         You tell it!
      
      
         
         Oh wait, I'm trying, I think.
         I can't remember.
         Um, like-
      
      
         It's not worth something, something-
      
      
         Oh, um, yeah, but my grandmother she, yeah, she's got some funny sayings.
         Like she'll, well she, when she's referring to my cousin Michael, he's kind of like, he's kind of the, I guess, the black sheep of the family.
         You know, just, he's my cousin and he's a year older than me but he can't, he can't keep a job and he's just got a-.
         He fails a lot at pretty much everything he does.
         But she always says that he's not worth the powder to take to blow his ass away!
         
      
      
         So, But, um, you know, it's pretty funny, of course, he doesn't, he doesn't think it, it's funny but she, that's her favorite thing to say.
         But she, she'll about anything to anybody and it's kind of embarrassing sometimes.
      
      
         Straight shooter?
      
      
         But, yeah, she's just, she's straight on with you.
         She'll tell you like it is and if you don't like it then that's just too bad.
         But we've come to realize that's her and that's just the way it's going to have to be.
         But, um, um, so my next story, I guess I want to talk about, uh, I guess I'll move on to kind of high school era.
         Um, we were, it was, I guess there were probably about maybe seven or eight of us, but I was the only girl.
         I hung out with a lot of my guy friends.
         We were always out kind of doing "boy stuff," and I guess I wasn't really like a tomboy but I did like to go fishing and hang out with the guys and stuff.
         But anyway, um, we were riding, um, there were probably about eight of us, and we were riding in the back of the truck.
         And I, I was in the back.
         And, uh, you know, I just kind of, it was Andy's truck and he was driving.
         And, um, we were going to Lake Twitty, and I kind of just got volunteered into going with everybody.
         So we were going cat fishing, but, and the guys had some beer.
         And, um, so anyway, we were just riding along and we pulled into, uh, and, oh!
         Something that I left out, Daniel had a light that he had, would, like a big flashlight that he was shining, and, um, not a flashlight, a spotlight and it had a blue light in it, and he was kind of flashing it around and just playing around with it.
         And, um, we pulled into the road that takes us to the lake and all of a sudden we, a car followed us, uh, followed in behind us and it was like a 300ZX.
         And, um, we pulled in and we stopped and he got out and but, just he was just kind of, we couldn't see him because he had, he had his lights on, his brights.
         And, um, he said, "Why don't you, why don't you point that thing over here to see what I got?"
         And, uh, he had, he had a gun.
         And well, come to find out he was a police officer but he was off-duty and he was in an unmarked car.
         And, uh-
      
      
         Monroe?
         Monroe police?
      
      
         Yeah.
         Monroe police.
         And, uh, so he had pulled us over because we were flashing the light.
         And, um, so, you know, Daniel said that, you know, he was sorry.
         He didn't realize that we were causing any trouble.
         But, um, he had told us that, um,
         .
         So, he says to us that, um, he shows us his gun and he said that he had, he almost shot us.
         And he acted really nervous and jittery and he acted like, he came up to the car kind of close and he acted like he did want to shoot us.
         And, um, he, but he didn't really care that we had, that we had, um, beer and he didn't mind that we were all under age or he didn't even know because none of us were of age.
         And so, you know, he didn't act like he really wanted to fill any papers on us or anything.
         It was kind of, you know, it was just like it was really scary.
         We didn't really know, really know what to expect from him.
         We didn't know that he was a cop.
         We didn't find this out till probably about 10 or 15 minutes later, until he was about to leave.
         But, um, he just was really nervous acting.
         He, he was definitely scaring me because he acted like he wanted something to happen.
         He was really mad at us for doing that.
         But yet he wasn't calling any backup or anything like that.
         And he was alone and he just seemed kind of scary.
         But we found out probably about a year later, or we saw on the news that was a year later, he had been arrested for, um, murdering a girl, um, in, in Monroe.
         And he pulled her over and murdered, and found out or got arrested for murder.
         And, uh, now he's in NC State penitentiary.
         So I guess we were lucky that night.
         But-
      
   

   
   
      
         This is an interview with Darlene Maurer interviewing Eric St. John.
         So, Eric, would you tell us what stories or book you remember reading as a child?
         What was your favorite story?
      
      
         Uh, my favorite book or stories were the, uh, phew, The Cat in the Hat because I always loved all of the colors.
         And there's always, all of the kids were having a great time while the parents left, and it was like one big, huge flight of fancy and they just go from one thing to another thing and it was like really fun and chaotic and just neat.
         And then, and then it was always like an adventure though because then all of a sudden, toward the end, like the parents are coming back.
         And we all know that if we don't have everything cleaned up you're going to get punished.
         And so it was like, "Can they do it?
         Can they do it?
         Can they get cleaned up in time?
         Are they going to make it?"
         So it's like having a blast and going on a flight of fancy and then coming back to reality and then like not getting caught
         , kind of.
         And they always did.
      
      
         And what age were you when you read this?
      
      
         Oh boy!
         I don't know.
         I was probably anywhere from, anywhere five on up.
         I don't have a lot of memories.
         I can remember four and earlier.
         They come once in a while, but I don't really have anything real strong.
         But, uh, I loved the colors and all the illustrations too, and just the zaniness.
         And then everything's, a little bit later I really I loved reading.
         I would be, this is more like when I was eight, nine, and ten, and 11 I would have a bedtime, and it was always way earlier than I wanted but I would lay, I would have this little lamp I'd put underneath my bedcovers and I would be reading.
         And I would read, I would read like baseball biographies.
         I loved baseball, still do, but, uh, you know, just to read about these famous people and dream about playing sports and being some kind of hero.
         And, uh, every once in a while, I think my dad caught onto that, but, uh, he'd come down and tell me to shut the, shut the lamp off every once in a while.
         But, uh, I'd usually, I just read and read and read.
         I'm surprised I didn't set the whole house on fire with that high intensity lamp.
      
      
         So what baseball hero did you want to be when you grew up?
      
      
         Oh, I wanted to be, uh, Harmon Killebrew because I was from MN.
      
      
         Hmm.
      
      
         He was the famous slugger from MN, played for the Twins.
         And then when I'd play baseball I, I could hit pretty good too, when I was real young.
         I couldn't in high school.
         I became a pitcher.
      
      
         Uh-huh.
      
      
         And they never hit, but, uh, I always loved biographies of, of famous people and events in history as I got older.
         And uh I still have kind of a passion for history and historical type things.
         Uh, golly.
         Also some of these other questions that also leads to the fact that, uh, my brother, you know, I had seven or six brothers and sisters, four until I was 11, and then three more joined the family when I was 11.
         And my, my younger brother was, he's like the most hilarious storyteller.
         And I remember his stories too because he would just make them up, and just, it would just be zaniness.
         And, yet, he was he was really funny too, and he could make faces and really creative even as a little kid.
         He's always the happy-go-lucky kid and I was the oldest.
         But it was a blast to hear him tell stories and then just start building off of them and just go all over the place.
         I guess that's kind of like The Cat in the Hat story too.
         But, uh, that was, I liked him.
         He was a really good storyteller.
         Now a good, as I get older, a really good storyteller is my other brother, who is like really serious.
         You never really catch him really laughing he's always really controlled.
         But he tells a good story with a dry sense of humor, and, uh, golly, he spent his career in the Army still; he just went to Germany.
         But, uh, those are the two best storytellers I know in our family.
         I remember my dad, my dad told us he would tell us stories about his childhood but usually, usually from him that, that doesn't really come until later.
         But, uh, when he would start telling about when he was a teenager some of the, some of the teenaged stuff he and his teenaged brothers did when they worked for their dad's business, my grandfather.
         Uh, I didn't, I never did know him.
         I don't remember him, he died when I was four.
         But it was hilarious just hearing what they did.
         I'm surprised they're still in business.
         Well they were in business.
      
      
         Do you remember any of the stories?
      
      
         Oh yeah.
         How hard it was, how hard it is, you know, way back then they would drive half-ton trucks.
         They were only half-ton trucks and they would drive grain feed around and coal and stuff to the farmers in MN in southern MN.
         But they would, the father, my grandfather wanted to save money so he would rig them up so they'd haul, he'd haul a ton and a half on a half-ton truck.
         And so he was constantly busting up and twisting up axles and he always he would get mad when the sons would do it,-
      
      
         Uh-huh.
      
      
         -which usually meant that they weren't being careful.
         But anyway their stories would go on and on about going one mile an hour up a hill taking forever to get somewhere driving getting up, a head up steam in the winter and Bucking snowdrifts is what they called it.
         The snowdrifts would come out into the streets into the road and, uh, this was in rural MN, so half the time you couldn't see where the road was anyway but they would go plowing these snowdrifts, you know.
         It was all fun and teenaged fun until you, until you ended up in a ditch in the middle of a blizzard.
         
         You broke the radiator or twisted an axle of a truck and had to call your dad and tell him what happened.
      
      
         Oh \\ ( ) \\.
      
      
         \\ And top of that \\, of course all the dad, all the grandfather wanted, he wanted the customer serviced.
         
      
      
         Get the job done.
      
      
         Of course, you're in the ditch trying to explain what happened but, uh-
      
      
         Was that your dad or his brother?
      
      
         Both.
      
      
         Both.
      
      
         Both would do that.
         I think my dad was the ringleader he was the oldest also.
      
      
         What year do you think that would have been?
      
      
         That was probably, uh, golly, my dad was born in 1926.
         So when he was 15 and 16ish, probably the early 40s, as best I can tell from those stories because they both went into the service very late; my dad went into the service at the very end of World War II and my uncle served in Korea.
         So that would be about right.
         
         I tell you, I don't really remember anyone reading stories to me that's, although I know my mom did.
         I just have a sense that, that happened but I don't remember specifics.
      
      
         What are some stories that you might tell yourself now that to help you through hard times?
      
      
         Well now, now the two stories would always be, uh, would be the story of Joseph in the Old Testament or, and, or the story of Paul in the New Testament.
         Which is in, Joseph, throughout his life, he was basically done wrong by his brothers and jailed unfairly and so on and so forth, but in the end, no matter, he didn't pay back his brothers even though he was the second most powerful man in Egypt.
         He just said, you know, the moral of the story, and what he said was, "You meant evil for me but the Lord meant good.
         That I might save," you know, "that many might be saved."
         Uh, and that's been a huge, a huge blessing and, and source of comfort.
         Especially in the midst of trials that, uh, no matter what's happening it's being done to, uh, for our, for our good and our, and our, uh, perfection, meaning, meaning that, uh, he's sanding off the edges constantly of us.
         And, uh, also the story of Paul, and, in particular, it's in, I think, it's in the Book of Romans, Romans 8:28 where he says, "All things work for good for those who love the Lord."
         Uh, and Paul, Paul's life is like a Indiana Jones movie, where, at one time, there's 40, 40 Jews, uh, Jewish scholars or whatever had taken the vow of hunger; until they caught him they weren't going to eat.
         So there's 40 guys who hadn't eaten in 30 days chasing them.
         So you reckon at least one of them is going to catch them somehow but he, he managed to elude them all.
         And then of course he spent the rest of his life you know on shipwrecks and in jail and being beat up, and, uh, I'm sure verbally abused and just you name it.
         But he counted all that joy, uh, for the work he was doing for the Lord.
         And, and that no matter what was happening, he was able, he was able to, uh, mentally adjust to the situation knowing that the Lord was working in his life, uh, for his good even if he couldn't always exactly see why.
         So that's it.
         And then, of course, the story of Jesus is the other one, uh, the biggest, uh, just about what he took on himself and that he was, you know, he was betrayed by everybody, his closest, closest friends, uh, and loved ones, uh, down to the last, the last disciple and apostle.
         Well, excuse me, just disciple.
         Uh, and yet he, you know, he still carried through with the Father's will, uh, and, and kept his composure and, and his perspective and focused no matter what.
         So those are the three that, no matter what the situation, there'll be something in those three lives that speak to me that I will repeat to myself, no matter what.
      
      
         Through difficult times?
      
      
         The harder it gets the more I will reflect on those lives and go back to the passages that talk about their lives.
      
      
         OK.
         Sounds like you get a lot of strength from your faith in Jesus.
      
      
         I get all of it, all of it from there.
         It happened three years ago and it's been amazing journeys I'm looking forward to the rest of it.
      
      
         Umm that's great, that's great.
         Is there anything else you'd like to share?
      
      
         That's about it I think.
      
      
         OK Eric, thank you.
      
      
         You're welcome.
      
      
         I appreciate it.
      
   

   
   
      
         I've never been timid in my life.
         This is a change of pace for me.
         I grew up in a small town east of Charlotte, Hamlet?
         There are only 5,000 people there, and in the 50's it was a great place to grow up.
         It's a railroad town and most people work for the railroad, including my dad.
         So we're all pretty much on the same economic plain.
         There wasn't too much difference between anyone.
         The schools were not integrated at that time, which was just a way of life.
         We didn't think of it as right or wrong, it was just the way things were.
         The biggest prejudice that we saw exercised at the schools, the children that lived out of town were called bus children, and they were brought into town on a bus, and they were grouped together in a class.
         They had to come earlier in the morning and had to stay later in the afternoon, and most of them were poor, because if you tried to farm in the sand hills of NC, it was pretty hard to make a living.
         The soil is not particularly fertile.
         The freedom that we had as children is unheard of today.
         There was nowhere in town that you couldn't ride on a bicycle or walk, as long as you told your mother where you were going and you were home by dark.
         I wish that my children, growing up in a different age where they didn't have this kind of safety and where everybody in the town didn't look out for them, could have had this experience of this much freedom.
         To be able to go into the woods on the edge of town and play without anybody worrying about me was a wonderful gift.
         And we had time to explore and imagine and do things, without adult supervision, which were totally innocent and great fun.
         
         There were many interesting characters in this small town, two of whom lived across the street from me.
         They were the Lann twins.
         These were identical twins who had dressed alike probably since the, they day they were born.
         By the time I was a child, they were well into middle age and were the most incredibly nosy people in this entire town.
         They went to the same church we went to, First Methodist, and they sat on a certain pew and woe be unto the person who sat, that chose to sit on the Lann twins' pew.
         They watched everybody's coming and going when we, we kids on the street became teenagers.
         They could tell you who everyone was dating and, if you were a girl, whether or not you got a goodnight kiss under the porch light and probably reported it at every bridge table they sat at for the next several weeks.
         Probably my most memorable occasion with the Lann twins was when my mother died.
         Um, my mother was very adamant about never telling her age.
         She was a good deal older than most people thought she was and she just didn't ever want that to be made public.
         She had made me promise that when she died that her age would not be put in the newspaper.
         She had been with us during her last illness, about six or eight weeks, where we were living in VA, and died there.
         When we came home for the funeral we had not been in the house more than five minutes and here come the Lann twins across the street.
         The first words out of their mouths, or out of one of them's mouths and their names were Augusta and Virginia, and I never knew who was who, so I don't know who asked the question.
         The first thing one of them asked was, "Kitty's age was not in the newspaper, how old was she?"
         I said, "Kitty didn't tell her age when she was alive and I just don't think we're going to start now."
         They were not even put off and did not even slow down.
         The next thing they wanted to know was I going to sell the things in mother's house and how much did I want for the mirror above the fireplace.
         It, I guess it was somewhat reassuring even then, that it didn't matter that they didn't express sympathy, but that some things never change and always stay the same.
      
   

   
   
      
         To hear your voice.
      
      
         I can hear my voice but not at through that.
      
      
         ( )
      
      
         You're not plugged in yeah maybe you are plugged in.
      
      
         I plugged in.
      
      
         Do I hear myself?
      
      
         Maybe sound a little bit different?
      
      
         Oh it always sounds different but.
      
      
         Uh-huh.
         
      
      
         Yeah, oh well.
         Yeah?
         Yeah OK.
         Do you want me to tell my story now?
      
      
         Yes please.
      
      
         OK.
         I am a native of Charlotte as was my mother and her parents before her.
         Mother always enjoyed telling me stories of how she spent her summer as, summers as a young child.
         Mother was raised not far from the square in Charlotte which is a very center of Trade and Tryon Street.
         She had neighbors and a church close by and the trolley stopped not far from her home.
         She and her sister could walk to school.
         When summer arrived with the steamy hot weather the family would pack up and go out to the country to the river the Catawba River.
         This meant packing a tent with cots for sleeping, pots to use over an open fire, dishes because of course there were no paper product at that time, food, and most important of all a cane pole, pole to go fishing.
         They would set out in an old car up Highway 16 to Shuffletown then down a long dirt road till they came to the creek bed.
         There they would set up camp near the creek for washing a spring for drinking the river was not far down the road.
         As I was growing up Mother would often show me the very spot that they camped.
         My great grandmother, who was in a big wooden wheelchair, paralyzed with arthritis, would go on this camping trip for the whole summer also.
         Mother and her sister spent their days playing in the woods, wading in the creek, swimming on the scuppernong vines and sometimes picking berries and going fishing.
         When the rain came my grandfather would tell Mother not to touch the tent with her finger because then the tent would leak so of course Mother would lay on her cot looking up at the tent close to her and touch it with her finger a slow drip would come and Mother would be in trouble but not as much trouble as when she was playing on the muddy creek bank and lost her shoe the only pair she had.
         Thank goodness this happened shortly before their return to the city where she could got another pair.
         All of Mother's life she loved to go barefooted she loved to go fishing for the small perch that she would fry with grits and the rain falling at night.
      
      
         Uh-huh.
      
      
         When they were camping at the river my grandfather would trap beavers and there were beaver dams.
      
      
         Uh-huh.
      
      
         The edge of the lake of the river.
      
      
         Uh-huh.
      
      
         Like the Catawba River and he would trap beaver and then he would come and he would skin them.
      
      
         Uh-huh.
      
      
         And he would hang up their hides.
      
      
         Uh-huh.
      
      
         And let them dry and then he would tan them with some process.
      
      
         Uh-huh.
      
      
         And bring them back to Charlotte and, sell them but in an, a, especially to the haberdasheries is that a hot, oh a hat manufacturer.
      
      
         Uh-huh.
         New.
      
      
         OK?
         A hat maker.
         And uh because at that time the ladies liked to wear beaver hats.
      
      
         Oh yeah I see.
      
      
         And so that was a way of getting added income.
      
      
         Oh so they are beavers in the Catawba River?
      
      
         They were at that time.
      
      
         \\Now they are no longer anymore?
         \\
      
      
         \\Her grandfather trapped them all.
         \\
         
      
      
         So he trapped the beavers just for the hide to make hats so he could make fashionable hats for the ladies.
      
      
         To sell them to for whoever would purchase them well.
      
      
         Oh, uh-huh.
         Yes, I see.
      
      
         A big customer was the hat makers.
      
      
         They were very slippery right?
         The beaver hide.
      
      
         No it's uh, well it might be slippery, but it's furry.
      
      
         Uh, but it's sparkling, it look very elegant, um.
      
      
         Probably.
      
      
         The men wore hats made out of beaver too.
      
      
         Did they?
      
      
         Why, I never see a beaver in the river.
         
      
      
         It has a big flat tail.
      
      
         Um.
      
      
         And they build dams.
      
      
         Um, oh.
      
      
         And he used some type of a trap.
      
      
         Uh-huh.
      
      
         That he fashioned himself.
      
      
         He pretty big right?
         Then they are very big.
         You cannot fish
         oh.
      
      
         The tail make it that big.
      
      
         \\The tail just the tail would be that big\\
      
      
         No, no, no.
      
      
         Uh-huh.
      
      
         The body about that big and the tail about that big.
      
      
         Uh-huh.
      
      
         All together.
      
      
         Oh it's like a big fish?
      
      
         Well it's a mammal.
      
      
         Oh.
         
         It's like a dolphin right?
      
      
         No.
      
      
         No it's like a rodent.
      
      
         It's more like a rat that live in the water.
      
      
         Live in the water?
      
      
         Uh-huh.
      
      
         They cut the trees down.
      
      
         \\Oh.
         \\
      
      
         \\Yeah\\ and they build dams to block.
      
      
         Oh.
      
      
         ( ) house the entrance way is beneath the water.
      
      
         Uh-huh.
      
      
         So they get have to dive down and come up inside their house.
      
      
         Um, well-- KT: But this place is still out.
      
      
         Uh-huh.
      
      
         On the Catawba River.
      
      
         Uh-huh.
      
      
         Still there it's not a uh dusty dirty road now it's a paved road now with several very, very expensive it's still preserved some the old beautiful houses on it.
         Shuffletown is still there.
         Highway 16 is still there.
         But this was the entertainment and I don't know how grandmother did it looking after her mother in a wheelchair.
      
      
         Uh-huh.
      
      
         They weren't of course was no running water.
      
      
         Uh-huh.
      
      
         No facilities whatsoever they weren't in a campground.
      
      
         Uh-huh.
      
      
         They were just out by creek.
      
      
         They had power, right, electricity.
      
      
         No water, kerosene.
      
      
         No, no.
      
      
         No water?
      
      
         No water other than what you would get from the spring.
      
      
         Uh-huh.
      
      
         No electricity.
      
      
         Uh, well that's amazing then that they could camp with no water and no electricity.
      
      
         \\Well they could get their water from the spring.
         \\
      
      
         Get water out of the creek.
      
      
         Yeah, um--
      
      
         And the tent was a big tent and I suppose it was made out of canvas.
         And they slept on cots.
      
      
         Uh-huh.
      
      
         Like an army cot that type of thing off the ground.
         And Mum said the tent would be very close to her face.
      
      
         Oh, oh yeah.
      
      
         You know and she would lay there and listen to the rain.
         She knew that her father said, "Do not touch."
      
      
         Uh-huh.
      
      
         Because if you touch it, it made it drip.
      
      
         Uh-huh \\ yes, yes.
         \\
      
      
         \\ It would leak in that spot.
         \\
      
      
         Uh-huh.
      
      
         And she would be on her cot and she would touch right up there.
         
      
      
         She's naughty.
         
      
      
         And then it would start and then it would start dripping.
         
      
      
         Oh yes, that's true.
         
         Well.
      
      
         OK that's one 15 minutes, but I don't, that's about it.
      
      
         She was born in Charlotte and raised
         and lived all her life in Charlotte.
         Her, uh, she lived in a city until the late 1920's when, uh, her father my grandfather lost his job.
         And the next job that he found was with the Charlotte Water Department and uh, had to move to the Water Department and that was about six miles from the center of the city and it was like the country.
         It was definitely the country.
         Most of the roads were dirt roads and uh, was far away from any public transportation.
         So Mother had to adjust to becoming used to a being a country girl.
         And
         one day in the summertime her good friend named Jackie had come from the city.
         Jackie had been a neighbor of Mother's and she had come to from the city out to the country to visit with Mother.
         And they were playing and they decided that they would go and pick up Jackie's sister who was at Jackie's house in the city.
         Well they had a little cart; had two wheels on it.
         And they hooked it up to a pony and they went riding towards Charlotte in the pony cart.
         They got just to the edge of the city, uh, when something spooked the pony and the pony reared up and when he reared up the uh cart turned over.
      
      
         Uh-huh.
      
      
         And the pony took off running.
      
      
         Oh.
      
      
         Well it ended up with the pony found his way with the cart behind it back to the house out in the country.
      
      
         Uh-huh.
      
      
         But there was Mother and Jackie halfway between town and halfway between the country house having to walk all the way, and, of course, they were all scuffed up and their clothes were all dirty
         and they were reprimanded when they uh arrived back home.
      
      
         \\ Oh, so the pony ( )\\.
      
      
         \\ Because they were not supposed to do it.
         \\
      
      
         Um, the cart got turned over and the pony found his own way back.
      
      
         \\ Yes the pony found, own way back.
         \\
      
      
         \\ While your mother and Jackie\\ were just left in the middle of the way and have to walk all the way back.
         
      
      
         \\ That was on the\\.
      
      
         \\ That was all the transportation.
         \\
      
      
         That was on the west side--
      
      
         Uh-huh.
      
      
         --of Charlotte.
      
      
         OK.
      
      
         OK.
      
   

   
   
      
         ( ) I hope it come out well.
      
      
         Well, we will tell a story about the, my mother and her sister and my grandfather, grandmother and the other five children went down to Chattanooga, where they had been raised in a place called Sequatchie Valley and my grandfather worked for the railroad.
         Uh so they had families and friends and they would go back and forth and visit and drive from Charlotte to Chattanooga, TN and back.
         Now it takes about five hours; used to take about a day and a half, I suppose.
         Um, the one day, were coming back, coming down the highway, uh they ran into some chickens and evidently hit a chicken and drove them back to Charlotte some distance, and when they go home from GA, coming back through GA, they got out of the car and there was a chicken, uh dead up against the radiator of the car.
         So naturally they got out of the car, took the chicken, and plucked the chicken, and boiled, uh, it, and cooked it, and had it for supper that night.
         
         The other is a story about our history of, I was married, um, Kaye and she seemed a quiet young lady from well-reserved family Presbyterian heritage.
         And later in life I found that her father when he was a young man rode a motorcycle.
         And in those days people that rode motorcycles around Charlotte were probably more rambunctious sort.
         He had an uncle out in CA, and so he rode his motorcycle from Charlotte, NC up to CA, um, not sure but maybe in Los Angeles area.
         And there he went in search of his uncle.
         His uncle had been into some kind of mischief and had been put in jail.
         He was serving on what we used to call chain gang and take your leg, put a clip around it and chain a ball on one end and then give you a shovel or rake or a pick he'd go out and maintain the highways.
         Well my wife's father found where his uncle was located and where he was working So in an opportune time he rode his motorcycle and got his uncle to hop on the back of the motorcycle and they headed for NC.
         And so, he helped his uncle escape the chain gang and after they got back in NC his uncle became sick, and within about three months, uh died from tuberculosis.
         And that's a story of my wife side of family not a story from my side of the family.
         RECORDING PAUSED THEN RESUMED
      
      
         In the early part of.
      
      
         Uh-huh.
      
      
         To, uh, that didn't have orphanages and things and so when a family, parents would die or someone couldn't take care of the children.
      
      
         Uh-huh.
      
      
         They would, uh, give them to another family to raise.
      
      
         Um.
      
      
         So my great grandfather, uh, adopted grandfather--
      
      
         Uh.
      
      
         --by common law.
      
      
         Um.
      
      
         He had some other brothers and sisters, and they went to other homes, but when his parents died.
      
      
         Uh-huh.
      
      
         My great grandfather did not have any children.
      
      
         Uh.
      
      
         Great grandmother did not have any children so they adopted my grandfather and they had a large farm, uh, and my great grandfather was very industrious.
      
      
         Um.
      
      
         And so they farmed the farm and then they set up a touring company and they bought automobiles and they would go up to NY and pick people up and drive them down to FL.
      
      
         Um.
      
      
         For vacation back and forth and it was a time when they didn't have glass windows in the car they had what we called "isinglass" which was not plastic but was made out of a \\material \\.
      
      
         \\ Oh.
         \\
      
      
         That rolled up.
      
      
         Uh.
      
      
         Or that they could hang a--
      
      
         Uh.
      
      
         So they would drive the folks back and forth from FL and then he created a construction company and in the First World War.
      
      
         Uh-huh.
      
      
         Went out and built the roads to go to a large camp that was here in Charlotte.
      
      
         Um.
      
      
         And so my father and my grandfather at that time, uh, were in involved in laying the, putting the road.
      
      
         Um.
      
      
         Into a military camp.
         Uh my grandfather had seven boys and three girls so they had a very large family
         they all worked on the farm
         and he educated his, most of his children, my father went to the seventh grade and quit school.
      
      
         Uh-huh.
      
      
         But his other brothers and sisters went on through school and went to uh, uh college.
         \\One\\
      
      
         \\Uh.
         \\

         Uh.
      
      
         There was a banker.
      
      
         Uh-huh.
      
      
         Uh, and so they had different positions but the tradition of my great, great grandfather and grandfather carried on to the children and my father who was not very well education.
      
      
         Uh-huh.

         Uh-huh.
      
      
         Made his own way in life and became a member of school board.
      
      
         Uh-huh.
      
      
         He went to the seventh grade and quit, and yet when he, um was older, and in business--
      
      
         Uh-huh.

         Uh-huh.
      
      
         Where he went to school, although he never graduated
         , and also the next two higher schools.
      
      
         Uh.
      
      
         He was on those boards.
      
      
         Oh.
         
      
      
         He used to kid and say that he went to, uh--
      
      
         Several schools.
      
      
         No he, he would go they would ask him, when the businessmen would ask him what fraternity he was a member of.
      
      
         Uh-huh.
      
      
         And he would always say "Hodskins" which was the name of the school where he where went.
      
      
         Uh.
      
      
         Up to the seventh grade.
         
      
      
         And they'd say, "What Greek letter is that?"
         and he'd say, "It's not Greek it's Southern."
         
         Hodskins fraternity.
      
      
         Uh.
         
      
      
         They kidded a lot in the family, played practical jokes on one another.
      
      
         Um.
      
      
         My father bought a mule that wouldn't--
      
      
         Um.
      
      
         --work for anyone but him.
      
      
         Uh-huh.
      
      
         And he would rent out the mule for people to plow their gardens and they would be so frustrated they would take the mule off to plow their garden and the mule wouldn't do anything.
         
         And they would bring him back home and fuss at him.
      
      
         Uh.
      
      
         Then he would laugh and give them their money back
         .
         My great, my grandfather--
      
      
         Uh.
      
      
         --developed the farm they were using into a residential area.
      
      
         Uh-huh.
      
      
         And he was good at doing things with his hands and some business but he took a lot tried to be a banker and he couldn't be banker because he built homes for people then financed the homes.
      
      
         Uh-huh.
      
      
         And uh he took the second mortgage.
      
      
         Uh-huh.
      
      
         And when the Depression came along back in the 1930's, uh, all those homes were taken over by the banks and he was left without anything and he was destitute.
      
      
         Uh.
      
      
         When he died he was very poor.
      
      
         Oh.
      
      
         But he had been fairly wealthy along the way.
      
      
         Uh.
      
      
         In that community ( ).
      
      
         And he named the streets in the community for his children he named, the name, the name of the community was Thomasborough which he named after the family.
      
      
         Thomas.
      
      
         Tom.
      
      
         They had, uh, a large, uh, home on the peak of the hill.
      
      
         Uh-huh.
      
      
         And, uh, they would ring a big dinner bell.
      
      
         Uh-huh.
      
      
         And the women would prepare for the workers and maybe they would have 50 workers come back and eat lunch behind the, um, house.
      
      
         Uh-huh.
      
      
         Out on the grass so when my grandmother and grandfather died the oldest son came through.
         He took the dinner bell and carried it off to his house he never used the dinner bell but it was a large bell like a church bell.
      
      
         Um.
      
      
         Uh, they met together as a community and they founded a church and they met in a place called the Cannery.
      
      
         Um.
      
      
         They built a large building put in pots to cook with and the people who had local farms could go there.
      
      
         Uh.
      
      
         And cook their food and put them in cans and jars.
      
      
         Uh- huh.
      
      
         And so it was a cannery and they started meeting at the cannery.
      
      
         Oh.
      
      
         Uh and then later built, built the church there in the community.
      
      
         Oh.
         It seems I don't know much about my family's history tree because since people choose not to tell stories I hear people choose to preserve the history and tell the stories so since that everybody here could tell stories about their family grandfather great grandfather well.
      
      
         And the house his great grandfather lived in had a step.
      
      
         Uh-huh.
      
      
         Out front that was made of slate.
      
      
         Uh, slate?
      
      
         Slate.
      
      
         Yes.
      
      
         And it that it's carved 1785.
      
      
         Uh-huh.
      
      
         That it could have been well that's what was that's what's in it and that's our front step at the front door.
      
      
         Oh.
         You move it here the slate?
      
      
         Uh-huh you'll have to look at it.
         It's a step and it has in it is it 1785?
      
      
         Oh.
      
      
         Not quite sure.
      
      
         That would have been your great grandfather.
      
      
         It would have been before me.
      
      
         Way, way back but it was at your great grandfather's house.
      
      
         Uh-huh.
      
      
         The house yeah.
      
      
         And the house burned down.
      
      
         Uh.
      
      
         And that was one of the few things that uh.
      
      
         Uh-huh.KT: A piece of slate couldn't burn.
      
      
         Uh.
      
      
         And Lamar's mother and father had it at their house out in the yard just on the ground at a tree
         .
      
      
         Uh.
      
      
         So when we built this house we made our, we planned it so.
      
      
         Uh.
      
      
         It was the length of this piece of slate so that's from his great grandfather's house.
      
      
         My grandfather's house in front of the it's like a yard square yard and at the end at the gate there is a pair of stone lions.
      
      
         Oh.
      
      
         And that's are very popular in China.
      
      
         Uh-huh.
      
      
         Lions seem to be the--
      
      
         The male and the \\ female with the paw?
         \\

         Oh.
      
      
         Or it seems to be like it seems to be protecting the prosperity and also, uh, just a sign of peace and prosperity and dignity for the, the family I think we have long history but nobody tells the story.
         
      
      
         I'm sure they do ( ) much further back than our ancestors.
      
      
         That's because the, the, you remember, uh, I don't know whether you went to that park or not.

         That's a that's a--
      
      
         I've seen \\ several pictures of it \\ in summertime.
      
      
         \\ Well the lady's house we went\\ to the other night.
      
      
         Oh yeah Nancy and John took that picture and she, she published \\ that article\\.
      
      
         \\ Newspaper.
         \\
      
      
         \\In the newspaper \\ we saw that.
      
      
         Yeah in the newspaper January 1999 that is a park built in 600 and 72 or something like that it's even 1000 more year
         .
      
      
         ( )
      
      
         One more thousand
         but nobody tells a story about that it's just not the tradition anymore.
      
      
         Well I think part of that is when you had the Cultural Revolution.
      
      
         Yeah I , I think so because--
      
      
         So many people didn't want to \\ let their history be known.
         \\
      
      
         \\ So many is feudal \\ because a lot of things like the lions some people were saying is the symbol of feudalism because it protect the emperor, emperor or empress--
      
      
         ( )
      
      
         In some things so people just choose not to tell stories it seems that as soon as, uh, the new nation is was established, everything should take a new look and--
      
      
         ( )
      
      
         We just a cut off and say bye, bye to the history.
         
      
      
         Ooh I loved hearing the stories of the emperors though.
      
      
         Uh-huh.
      
      
         And all the concubines.
         
      
      
         Concubines?
      
      
         The mistresses.
      
      
         Wives.
      
      
         The wives.
      
      
         Oh.
      
   

   
   
      
         Good Afternoon.
         Uh, I understand that you are interested in some stories that I heard as a very young boy.
         Uh, thinking of some of them now uh, one of them was uh, "Three Bears".
         The Mama Bear, the Papa Bear, and uh, the Baby Bear, and of course they struggled a long competent from each other.
         I heard that story a long time ago, and it is, uh, it has stuck with me.
         Uh, also another one was uh, "The Raven," the poem "The Raven" uh, that we read in school and uh, we had to determine what it was about, and um, it wasn't easy at first for us to do that, and that, that story or poem went something like this, "Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary, over many a quaint and forgotten lore, while I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping, as if some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door, it is some visitor I said only this, and," uh, "nothing more."
         Of course the story went on for several pages.
         And we were to tell what it was about and uh, and uh, I don't think any of us in that class really came up with the answer.
         Teacher finally told us that it was, it was a bird.
         Uh, my family did not uh, all they
         told were some stories but, but they usually talk about past experiences uh, when they were growing up uh, when they were courting, and uh, during their early years of marriage, and uh, this kind of thing.
         I can remember uh, some of those stories now, uh, my mother would tell the story of a my uh, great grandmother, my grandmother sitting in the door of living room, when uh, my daddy would go to see her, before they got married and, and of course she would sit there until they leave, and sometimes she would act as though she was sleeping and got rather quiet, she would ( ).
         In other words, I went to the conclusion that there was strict supervision of, of teenagers uh, while they were under the influence of their parents.
         Uh,
         I would like to tell you about some traveling that I've done.
         I've been to uh, to counseling conferences at University of Michigan, no it was at Michigan State University, at East Lansing, MI.
         Uh, and the purpose of these three visits was a conference on counseling third world students.
         And, of course, the goal of this, uh, these sessions was to help individuals to become more familiar with uh, some of the uh, concerns and problems that uh, they may have due to language uh, new country and ability to uh, interpret what's happening around them.
         Um, we had a lot of good speakers and we had representation from uh, a large number of different ethnic groups, and uh, this proved to be very beneficial, and the most important thing to me was while I was there I read in the library a, a book that listed scholarships that have been listed and given out by the ( ) Foundation, and they listed uh, a couple of people who were on Michigan State's campus as uh, individuals who had served as readers for uh, the proposals that were sent.
         So, immediately, as soon as possible, rather, I got on the phone and I called over to Justine Morrow School and I got a chance to talk with the director who knew about the uh workings of ( ) Foundations and grants.
         I went in to conference with them, and I went over to uh, talk with them in person and explain to him what I wanted to do and showed me how I could incorporate the mandates of uh, scholarship that I was trying to get, the fellowship.
         Uh, and to a study uh, an experience related event.
         So it boiled down and I ended up working on uh the national design of uh, experiences that would help students from small areas make the transition from rural to uh, to larger cities, in eastern NC and of course I based that on the basis of high percentage of individuals who left the area after college and went to larger cities many of them succeeded more than we would like to.
         I guess basic problems in the transition from uh, small towns and rural areas to uh, the large cities.
         So, I wrote this proposal to do this and I got an interview from one of the readers who was from Kentucky and I met him in Greensboro, he interviewed me.
         In three or four weeks later, I was notified that I had received, which was for one year of study at uh, Temple University and it offered a stipend of $7,000.
         Uh, this was quite helpful uh, to me and also uh, while I was there I received a grant to uh, improve minority scholars on uh, predominately minority campuses which was known as AEP, Advancement of Education of Personnel, and of course this was given out on four different campuses, Bowie, Coppin, Livingstone, and Elizabeth City State uh, colleges and maybe one or two others and we would, they would send four people in the summer for study and two would return for the winter and two would stay and by doing this uh, each person in the group was able to get in their one year residency and continue studies.
         Uh, by uh, taking at least one semester off campus with continuous education and of course uh, returning in the summer, courses that were taken off campus when we return to our respective campuses had to be approved and they sent a professor to these campus to uh, interview us two or three times a year as to the progress that uh, we were making toward the uh, plan of study that we had made.
         OK uh, so guess you've decided by now that, that I did not have it easy growing up, in fact I did not expect to get the opportunities that I received but by making necessary contacts, good contacts, and uh, meeting people who were movers and shakers and could influence my career, I was able to build on that and uh, and to get a terminal degree at uh, Temple University in Urban Education, which helped me when I returned to my own campus to move from counseling to uh, Social Science Education, and uh, study in a society professor moving into the position of professorship uh, with tenure before I left.
         So uh, these are some good things that I think I uh, happen to good people.
         There is a book I've heard individuals lecture upon and I've read some of it myself, Why do Bad Things Happen to Good People?
         And this is true, everybody does not uh, deserve unfortunate things that happen to them.
         But it is my philosophy that a lot of good things happen to uh, good people and that more than likely they will happen to good people, because they will be on the right track.
         Now, um, uh,
         these, these ideas have stuck with me through the years and I guess there is a combination of stories that I've heard, speeches that I've heard, and uh, and of course books that I've read.
         But I remember when I was in college at A&T State University, W.O. Kerrington speaking uh, and he used for a subject that for every soul open its own way ( ).
         And he went on to say that high soul chooses the high way, the low soul chooses the low way.
         And in the midst, is the misty flats which most people choose, and then he went on to talk about the middle road being crowded uh, the low road meeting destruction, and disappointment, tragedy.
         But, the high road leading to success and opportunities and even then, though we were quite young, he challenged us it seemed to get through that if we selected the high road that benefits had the possibilities of being numerous and sometimes when I'm out alone, when test and trials come, those words come to me,
         a group of words were uttered by ( ) that we were expected to learn and we were expected and required in high school to learn poems, to read poems and try to interpret poems that we could think of, and one of them was by Kipling, which was "If" and I don't recall all of it now, but it went on to say that "if you can dream and not make your dreams your master, if you can think and not make your thoughts your aim, you can meet with triumph and disaster.
         Treat those two imposters just the same" and it goes on the say that if you can do all these things, yours is the world and all that is in it.
         And what is more that you will be a man or woman in life.
         ( ) That was meant to be nonexistent language at that time.
         Uh, so that has been a source of inspiration to me.
         Sometimes when I might have a, have exploded, used other approaches, I sought to keep my head when it seemed like everybody else was not thinking at the moment.
         What inspires one individual uh, may inspire another and may inspire something else.
         These, these are things that, that I would like to share with and I will tell you look at about my background.
         Let's see, my mother taught in the schools of North Carolina for 30 some years, over 35 years and my father uh, was a minister and uh, I have three brothers, no sisters and have always wished that I had sisters so that I can understand maybe girls a little bit better than I do.
         Ladies but, uh, that's the way it came out.
         We were a loving family.
         We did a lot of, most things together, worked together, we grew up in a rural area and we worked together, we ate together, we uh, went shopping together.
         We went to church together and uh, that bonded us to the extent that we have remained relatively close though gone our separate ways to different parts of country uh, because of that early loving and care, and concern.
         We were taught and soon acquired being concerned about each, each other.
         Played with animals, grew plants.
         This has helped me uh, as I've gone out on my own to be able to grow plants and find enjoyment and relaxation, working in that area when I can find time to do so.
         I would not want to get anyone to cut my grass and thought they would do it free because I enjoy doing it myself.
         I did go to the Philippines.
         When I graduated from uh, from Temple University as a present for my graduation.
         I spent 30 days there, I visited the embassy, I met some individuals.
         I got an opportunity to uh, school with them.
         Which they would go out into the bars, I think they called it in Manila, and on the weekend I spent one weekend there I had a chance to taste the foods, uh, to sleep under the uh, net, see little bit of a cock fight.
         To go to the swimming to pool and to make um, very beautiful pictures.
         And I found uh,
         I found everybody was very warm toward uh, me as an American.
         I don't know why I would do that by myself.
         I went by myself, basically without one, in a tour group and my visit after I got there.
         I didn't have any problems except uh, when I was getting ready to leave it was in the monsoon season.
         It was raining very hard.
         When the cab came to the hotel to take me to the airport I had my pull off my shoes and socks and wade halfway up my legs to get to the airport.
         Once I got to there, I dried them up and put them on.
         It wasn't very long before the plane was in and we headed back to the United States through the way of Guam and laid in Hawaii and California, Washington D.C. and uh, back to Norfolk, VA.
         So, that I shall always cherish and it helped me to understand other cultures and helped me to appreciate the uh, opportunities that I had in the United States.
         Uh, I hope to return to work uh, the in an embassy level position with some of those that would go on the international teams of teachers, doctors and so forth.
         But uh, the Iranian Crisis, hostage crisis, took place a few months after that and I was never able to get that, that off, but I had a vision, I had a desire to return again.
         Well, never done anything like this before but I hope that I said something like that uh, will help you to understand what it is like to grow up in uh, North Carolina and uh, the values that are perpetuated are taught, by good, well-thinking parents and the love and concern for each other that is expressed in many ways.
         Uh, nobody, nobody had lost to make us treat each other right.
         But at that time women were put on a pedestal and treated with the highest degree of respect and they were devout and loving to their husband and they didn't feel anybody was putting something on them and becoming unnecessarily agitated uh, because somebody didn't do something according to term.
         Uh, we had ( ) School was a happy place, place for play, we had limited supervision at a small high school and students basically uh, loved the teachers.
         The teachers lived in the community, primarily; they visited the churches.
         And sometimes members of the churches that students went to.
         So, they saw the students in non-academic settings as well as in academic settings.
         They knew the parents and of course they had the confidence of the parents and um, students tried to do the right things because they did not want their teachers to tell um, their mother on them.
         Because if they did, the mother wouldn't curse the teacher out, she, she would penalize the student in some way and um, most students didn't even have to go through that because they did the right thing because it was the right thing to do.
         And never heard of fights, well we had some little fist fights but not with guns and that kind of thing uh until very recently in the area I grew up and I still haven't heard of it happening there, but I've heard of it happening in other parts of NC and the United States.
         But uh, parents spent a lot of time at that time with um, their children.
         I think this is, this is the key and missing ingredient, many of them are busy working everyday.
         They have other problems, they have children while they are young.
         They want to socialize and many times the children left to fend for themselves and to make choices and of course they fail to make the proper choices.
         Role models, certainly are needed in our communities and uh, in our schools also uh, because students mirror what they hear and what they see.
         Uh, and if they see adults doing some other things they we, accuse them for, uh, they figure that this is cool.
         These individuals become their heroes, and uh, they try to emulate them.
         Uh, one final thing that I must mention is religion was more of an important factor in the lives of young people when I was a teenager.
         Growing up, almost everybody went to church and students went with them and it sure didn't make them perfect, but it seem to uh, place some fear in their minds, some people today I think have no fear, even fear of death.
         They think they're going to come back, it's some temporary vacation and they don't realize when they use violence or they when they overdose how permanent it is.
         So if we don't, people have different tendency of churches and religions, Judaism, Hinduism, ( ), Christianity and then you have Atheist.
         But if we don't use any of those, uh, we need something that can cause us to think and let us know that we are not really masters of our own fate, captains of our own souls, but uh, that we are dispensable, that we are passing through here for a short period of time.
         It's important to make our mark in the sand and one way to do it certainly is to live a decent life and uh, if we can do that and add education competencies and skills that we can help lift someone else then uh, we would come to the end of the road with joy and happiness I think uh, saying that we have helped to make the world better.
         Thank you.
      
   

   
   
      
         OK, this is my second interview with Larry Wentz, my father.
         He is also living in Lincolnton, WV, but he's originally from, but, um, I mean
         , he's living in Lincolnton, NC, sorry but he's originally from Buckhannon, WV.
         OK.
         Dad, um, what was it like growing up in Buckhannon for you?
      
      
         Buckhannon was uh, uh, a very small and close-knit town.
         Uh, what I enjoyed the most growing up was, uh, was the college campus.
         It's the home of West Virginia Wesleyan College and that was my playground, that was my own, the place where I spent so much of my childhood playtime and, uh, running through the different buildings and structures of the campus.
         Uh, having a free reign, going and coming as I pleased almost, because my grandfather was the Dean of the College.
         And, and everybody knew me so nobody really tried uh, to uh corral me, so I was sort of free to go and do what I wanted, you know when the buildings were open.
         And uh, just uh, using that campus as a playground to, um, have war games and, and do all kinds of adventurous, uh, you know, hide and seek times and things like that with my friends; a lot of roller skating, a lot of raking leaves in the fall and to making leaf houses and all kinds of things like that is uh, very memorable.
      
      
         OK
         Um, Dad, what was it, the, what were some, what are some of the main things that you remember about your grandfather who was Dean of Wesleyan?
         I think his name was Grandfather Schoolcrafts
         Grandfather Schoolcraft.
         Sorry.
      
      
         Um, some of the things that I remember is a small office that, uh, we would go into a lot.
         He had one of those old-fashioned, uh, recorder machines that, uh, had a cone on it where the needle would imprint your voice onto a cylinder cone.
         I don't know the technical name for the machine now.
         But, uh, I would always hide is his closet a lot in his office, you know, or maybe he put me in there for disciplinary reasons.
         I don't know, I just remember being in there a lot.
         Um, he had about two or three secretaries, and um, they were always nice, and, um, it was just a fun thing to see his name on the door and to know that he was an important man, but he was also my grandfather.
      
      
         OK, Thank you.
         Um, do you feel that Buckhannon is a place that you will ever want to return to live in the future?
         And, why or why not, or why did you like living in Lincolnton, NC so much?
      
      
         As far as Buckhannon being a place I would want to retire in or retire back to, uh, I don't see that in the future to me.
         Uh, not that it's not a nice town, there are a lot of good memories and so forth there.
         It's more of a place in my life now that I like to visit, um, I don't see the change in it that I do in NC.
         As far as WV compared to NC, I don't see the change, um, and maybe the change is something that I enjoy and, uh, that's why I sort of tend to think that if current change, intend to think I'll be retiring, um, in, um, NC or TN.
         Someplace like that, that is more south.
         But, I enjoy WV and I enjoy going back and meeting friends and uh,
         stirring up memories.
      
      
         OK, um we're certainly not doing anything for promoting tourism for WV today.
         But uh, with my last two interviews, but I digress, anyway.
         
         ( ) Dad, Dad, um, do you remember going to Audra State Park a lot when you were a younger teenager, and if so, what kinds of things would you do there, including snake hunting, drinking of alcohol, etc?
      
      
         Jess, I never hunted snakes because I don't like snakes.
         Uh, we did see them in the water occasionally and screamed and yelled and ran, you know.
         There was the occasional bottle of alcohol consumed, in the water, on the water, around the water, um.
         I'm glad those days are gone, way gone.
         But, uh, Audra State Park was a fun place, we would get on our bicycles and in our teenage years before we could drive and that was a good 10-11 miles over hill and dale to get there and we would definitely ride our bikes there and spend the day, even walk, uh hitch hike, and walk the railroad tracks which cut the distance down considerably, just to, uh, spend a day in the water and, uh, hunting, uh, you know, exploring, and uh, just enjoying seeing new people and different people you never saw before.
      
      
         OK, um,
         , do you remember any ghost stories or scary stories, from uh,
         around the area of Buckhannon?
         Or Audra?
         Or Sago?
      
      
         Or come up with a different question.
         No I don't remember any scary stories, because I don't believe in scary stories.
         And there weren't any really, except headless farmers that would come out at midnight on certain days of the year and throw potatoes at you!
         
         If you were walking the road at night.
      
      
         Yes, I think that's a favorite for lots of folks around the country.
         Um, oh, I, um asked Linda the same question because we are getting ready to move into the year 2000, a new century.
         Dad, what is your fav,
         what is your favorite movie of the century and why?
         Linda's was The Sound of Music.
      
      
         Put that on pause.
      
      
         My favorite movie of the century-- \\
      
      
         \\ Well, a few of them, two or three.
         \\
      
      
         Would be, From Here to Eternity.
         Uh, I did like Creature from the Black Lagoon when I was a child.
         That was one of the scariest movies I ever saw.
         And The Mummy, because that was a good one too.
         I liked Frankenstein.
         I liked the Werewolf.
         My mother made me see all these scary things that's why I'm warped and hairy today.
      
      
         What is a favorite movie since the age of 30 or above?
      
      
         Um, my favorite movie uh, since the age of 30, I sure do like The Wizard of Oz, before I was ten.
         Since the age of 30 I guess it would have to be Fiddler on the Roof, I love that movie.
         I also enjoy um, Scarlet Pimpernel and Hook.
         And Black Beauty.
      
      
         
         OK.
         We all understand why you like um, Scarlet Pimpernel because
         it was such an intriguing story of
         revolutionary proportions, but why do you identify so much with the Jewish plight portrayed in Fiddler on the Roof?
      
      
         Um, well my favorite part was the two staircases, one going up and one coming down, or there were three actually, one going nowhere, in between.
         
      
      
         
         Dad, come on, you're making no sense at all.
      
      
         I know I'm at the no sense time of this interview.
         I don't make any sense now.
         What do you want me to say?
      
      
         ( )
      
      
         Fiddler on the Roof, I like the story, I like the fact that-- \\
      
      
         ( )
      
      
         Oh yeah, I like old what's his face's voice, I like to sing like he does.
         I like the song, I like his beard, I like his prayer shawl.
         And um, I like the fact that, um, it's a wonderful story about the some of the traditions, some of the type of holocausts that some of the Jewish people had to go through living in that country and at that period of time and, um, just, uh, just, uh something in my heart, that, uh, maybe Jewish roots from centuries back or something that, uh, tends to make me feel the way I do about the movie.
         Um, being um, Jewish born again myself, I have that tendency to uh, know about the plight of the Jews and sympathize with them.
      
      
         OK, thank you.
         Um Dad, we're getting close to Christmas and the media has had such a fun time the last few weeks talking about shopping on the Internet.
         In this new age of technology with e-mails, websites, um, downloading this and that, do you feel overwhelmed with those kinds of terms?
         Um do you feel like you are able to get on a computer and understand it?
         Or does it sort of scare you?
      
      
         It sort of scares me, I am so confused.
         That's all I can say, that was a horrible question.
      
      
         Linda, did you think that was a horrible question?
      
      
         No.
      
      
         I thought it was.
         I mean-- \\
      
      
         \\ Do you like computers?
         I mean you're going to, you are opening a new business-- \\
      
      
         \\ I am computer illiterate, so I don't have a like or dislike for them because I don't know what they can do for me.
         \\
      
      
         \\ You're getting a new retail business started and-- \\
      
      
         And someday I'll like computers.
      
      
         Some people sell a lot more on the Internet.
         Do you think that with this business, um, you're going to have to learn how to do it-- \\
      
      
         \\ Sure.
         \\
      
      
         \\ And become acquainted with the-- \\
      
      
         \\ Sure.
         \\
      
      
         Internet, where you can sell your tree water.
         That is water from the made from the maple.
      
      
         \\ Squeezed from the might maple.
         Squeezed we are talking hand squeezed.
         Milked from the tree.
         \\
      
      
         \\ It's a one of a kind folks.
         Anyway-- \\
      
      
         \\ My hands hurt.
         \\
      
      
         \\ Straight from WV.
         So there's one good thing about WV we can talk about-- \\
      
      
         We got strong hands.
         Milking them trees.
      
      
         Okey-dokey.
         \\ Um, we-- \\
      
      
         \\ How much did you say you were going to pay me for this?
         \\
      
      
         You're not getting paid, Dad.
         OK, um, what, uh, what is your favorite show of the century and why?
      
      
         My favorite show of the century-- \\
      
      
         \\ A lot of people say Seinfeld, what do you think about that?
         \\
      
      
         No, I like Archie Bunker All in the Family, with Edith.
         That's my favorite time of growing up.
         I can remember it very well.
         In fact I was humming the tune today.
         ( )
      
      
         I'm not a bigot.
         But I enjoyed the TV series.
      
      
         OK.
      
      
         ( )
      
      
         I'm sitting looking at my kitten Cordelia, who I've named after a popular character in a TV show, Buffy the Vampire Slayer.
         Um what do you think about the rise of occult, occultic matters or TV shows, movies about the occult.
         Why do you think they're becoming so trendy in recent years?
      
      
         Uh, I feel that man basically is a spiritual being first and he is always trying to get to the root problems of his personality and his surroundings.
         God creates in the spirit, creates in the natural and, uh, man does the same, and man's trying to find his creativity of the spiritual realm and I feel he's just, um, the day and age is getting closer and closer to end times, as far as I believe, the word of God says, and so the days are drawing closer to where man will be harboring more and more blackness in his heart, it will prevail.
         And, uh, man will be trying to find, uh, you know, the cause of life, so I don't know.
         It's just, um, it's a deep subject to talk about, a very broad subject to talk about, but being spiritual beings, I guess the shortest way of saying it.
         Man's fantasy and tendency is to go into the occult, into black magic and the dark side because that's where he dwells and that's where his heart is, uh, settled in right now and until you know the Lord and know the true meaning of life and your purpose you're always searching in the dark side for the, the meaning of reality and the meaning of life, always trying to find out about the future.
         I remember when I was kid, I was always trying to, uh, find out about the future because of the fear that it brings.
         But, uh, by knowing the Lord those fears are all removed.
      
      
         OK, and also we think goodness for Buffy that we have her to fight back against these evil people.
         Especially the vampires and demons.
         Now--
      
      
         ( )
      
      
         Um one last question Dad, um
         , what is your favorite time of year and why?
         Do you like spring or summer or winter or fall and why?
      
      
         What's my fifth choice?
         Hum, my favorite time of year is summer.
         I enjoy spring and I enjoy fall, but summer is the best.
         I'm a summer person.
         I love warm weather, I love the colors that summer brings.
         And uh, life, I just enjoy everything is alive and at its peak in the summertime.
         And, um, my favorite time of the year because, uh, as a kid I really enjoyed myself more during the summer I wasn't a, uh, person that got into sports so it wasn't like a fall thing or a spring type mentality but, uh, or winter sports, so um, I just enjoy summer.
      
      
         OK, I lied and said that was my last question.
         I have a few more actually.
         \\ Um.
         -- \\
      
      
         \\ Repent!
         \\
      
      
         I asked Linda what she, if she could remember meeting you in junior high and why she fell in love with you.
         
         Can you give me some feedback on your first encounter with Linda Stonicker in junior high or high school?
      
      
         My first encounter with her was by phone, when I called her up to ask her out for my friend Tom, because Tom was a chicken.
         He was a dweeb.
         And so I call her up knowing that she probably wouldn't go out with him, hoping she wouldn't.
         But, and she didn't hallelujah!
         And so I asked her out and she said, "Yes!"
         And that was my first encounter.
         My second encounter was kissing her rosy lips.
      
      
         Larry!
         
      
      
         Oh forget it, I got overwhelmed by my first encounter.
      
      
         OK, and also one last question and Dad I promise this is the last one.
         What do you think about my husband Bob?
         
         Since he's not here to defend himself.
      
      
         What do I think about Bob?
         Well, for the last year, year and half, everybody I've ever met that we've talked to about Jessica and Bob, I've right from the start said that Bob was the one I would have picked out for my daughter for a husband.
         Of all the jerks that she ever paraded through my living room, or some of them wouldn't even parade through my living room, they just would stay in the car because they knew better.
         Um, he had to be the, um, best looking, the most appealing for her.
         Um, his character he's blooming, but, uh, I always say that to my friends that he would have been the one I'd pick and I'm happy and very glad that I have him for a son- in-law.
      
      
         OK, and we're sure that he appreciates that.
         Um, once again that was an interview with my father, Larry Wentz who is originally from Buckhannon, WV and now resides in Lincolnton, NC.
      
   

   
   
      
         OK.
         This is the first interview for 4260 with my step mom Linda Wentz.
      
      
         Hello.
         
      
      
         
         Sorry, um, Linda grew up in a small town in WV called Buckhannon.
         Linda, what did you like
         think about living there?
         What did you think about living there?
         Sorry.
      
      
         Well, I, when I was a little kid I didn't really think a whole lot about it, except that was my home.
         I loved the house that I lived in when I was a little girl, and it was very small, and I lived on a street called Fayette St., and it had a wonderful maple tree in the front and I liked to climb it, I was a tomboy.
         So one of my favorite things do to was, you know, roller-skate and climb trees.
         I had a little, I have three brothers, at the time when I was smaller I only had two because my youngest brother Jimmy hadn't been born yet.
         So my younger brother Jimmy and I, and the next door neighbors would play, and I guess, really Buckhannon was like a very wonderful town to grow up in because there wasn't a lot of crime it was just very safe, a very safe place.
      
      
         How long have you lived in Lincolnton, NC?
      
      
         Nine years.
      
      
         
         OK,
         Um, you're now married to the man that you dated in high school.
         How did you meet him in high school?
      
      
         Well, actually I met him in junior high.
         And I was in the seventh grade and he was in the ninth grade.
         And, um, at lunchtime what we did was we would go to the gym and everybody would eat their lunch in the gym on the bleachers and they would have, they would play records and then the kids would dance.
         Of course, you know, I was very skinny, I was cute but not the kind of girl that guys were looking at, and, I but I used to watch your dad dance with all the other girls and he was a wonderful dancer and I really liked him.
         Used to sit and look at the kids dance and I'd listen to Beetles songs.
         I would look at Larry and I had picked him as the one I'd always wanted to dance with and it wasn't until we got into high school that he noticed me.
         And I was in a
         a talent show with my girlfriend and we did a modern dance to "Pink Panther," and after that my phone didn't stop ringing for awhile.
         And your dad called me and asked me if I wanted to go out with is best friend Tom Rigger, and I said, "Never."
         This guy was not my type and so he said, "Would you like to go out with me?"
         and I said, "Yes, I would," and so that's when we started dating.
      
      
         Why did you like him?
         Besides the fact that he could dance?
      
      
         Well, he was very handsome and I, um, loved his smile, had a beautiful smile.
         And he was, you know, just tall and thin and there was just something about him that I found very, very attractive.
         And he was funny and I liked to laugh.
         Well we just, I really fell kind of madly in love with him,
         at 15.
      
      
         What do you miss most about not living in Buckhannon, WV?
      
      
         Nothing.
         
         As a child I loved it, but as I grew up there just really wasn't a whole lot that Buckhannon had to offer other than the fact that, you know, was where my memories of childhood are and my parents.
         And I like going home to visit my parents and seeing my friends but as far as wanting to live there, I wouldn't.
      
      
         OK, I think y'all have a phone call.
         Let's pause for a moment.RECORDING PAUSED THEN RESUMED
      
      
         OK, we're back.
         What are some funny words that you first heard in NC that you'd never heard before that made you laugh?
      
      
         Well, I guess the first funny world I heard was "Hey!"
         And I couldn't figure out what everyone was talking about.
         You know, they'd say "Hey, how you doing?"
         \\ And you know, we always say-- \\
      
      
         \\ Hay is for horses.
         \\
      
      
         Or "hi" or "hello," and so that, that, this was kind of funny to me.
         Another one of the things that everyone says here, you'll say something to them and they'll say, "Well."
         They say, "well" a lot, it's just a, I don't know what, something that they use to say when they don't know what else to say--
      
      
         It's a hesitation.
      
      
         A hesitation.
         Yeah, well, and, uh, another interesting word was "picking".
         I went right into the school system and I was teaching and, um, it was a little awkward at times and the kids were, they would tease, and instead of saying, you know, I'm teasing, they would say-- \\
      
      
         \\ Hello baby!
         \\
      
      
         They would say, "Mrs. Wentz," and a, you know, another thing they'd make syllables where there isn't even any syllables at all.
         They would, they would make syllables, for instance, my name is Wentz.
         It was, "Mrs. We-ntz, just picking Mrs. We-ntz."
         And "ill" to me that is when you're sick, but people here say, "Well, I was just really ill," which means they were upset or angry or something like that.
      
      
         OK, what about Sundrop?
         Do you like it?
         Does--?
         Is it a drink of your choice?
      
      
         
            
         
      
      
         Lots of people around here seem to think it is
         it's a, what's it called,
         drink of the gods.
      
      
         Um, well, I, you know, I think it's OK, but it's nothing that I was, that I would want everyday.
         That or Cheery, Cheerwine.
         Those, those are two drinks that I don't crave.
      
      
         OK, Oh, what do you think is, uh,
         best, movie of the century?
         Since it's almost the year 2000.
         
      
      
         
            Oh, um, The Sound of Music.
      
      
         Why?
      
      
         Why?
         Well, I guess I, well I love Julie Andrews, and I like, I really love the music that's in The Sound of Music.
         I like the whole background, the plot.
         And everything.
         And, um, it just makes me feel good.
         In fact, I watched it three times th, this past Christmas, because, I hadn't seen it in awhile, and I loved it so much, that I had to watch it over and over again.
      
      
         OK, um, since we are talking about a movie based in Europe.
         Where are your ancestral roots, Linda?
      
      
         
         Well, my father's family came from Germany.
         My last name is Stonicker.
         And, um,
         one of my grandparents was also from France.
         So there's, there's sort of a mixture there.
         And my mother's family, her last name was Corley.
         And she was, I think.
         -- \\
      
      
         \\ Irish?
         \\
      
      
         Irish, yeah, so I guess it would be kind of a German-Irish mix.
      
      
         Do you miss your dad who lived in Buckhannon, WV?
         And what are some special qualities about him that you can talk about?
      
      
         
         Yeah, I miss my dad.
         I miss my mom.
         But my mom is in heaven.
         My dad is a very, very special man.
         He, um, he grew up in WV and he, um, played football when he was in high school and he went right into the service and he was in WWII, he was a medic in the army.
         And he was over in Europe.
         In fact, I was just talking to him this last Thanksgiving about some of the things that he went through when he was in the service and, and traveling across the sea on these boats that had flat bottoms and they would go way up in the, in the water and then smack down, you know, it was very rough.
         They left out of NY and went to Scotland.
         And, um, he said you would look out if you were up on deck and the waves, the swells were way up higher than, than the boat itself and looked like you were going to drown.
         But the Queen Mary was right beside to them.
         They were in a fleet.
         And the WACs were on the Queen Mary, and, you know, they just had a smooth sailing trip when these poor guys in the army, you know, they were just so sick almost every day because of the, the boats and everything.
         But I, my dad is, um, he's just a very sweet man.
         You know my mother's been gone for four years.
         And he has, he's 81 years old.
         And he takes care of the house wonderfully.
         When we came home for Thanksgiving dinner he had everything prepared, had the turkey in the oven and everything ready.
         He's just a really fine guy.
      
      
         81?
      
      
         He's 81 years old.
         
         He's a retired driller.
         He drilled wells all of his life all over WV, VA, and KY.
      
      
         
         OK.
         That's nice.
         
      
      
         
            
         
      
      
         Um, did
         um where, where did you go to college at?
         And why did you want to be an artist?
      
      
         Well, ( ) I wanted to be an artist when I was little girl.
         The first painting that I did that I really remember was a finger painting that I did of one of my dolls.
         And it was just so exciting to me and I was probably only about five years old.
         But I propped my doll up and I had my finger paints and I looked at her and I did this portrait of her and it was just really good to me, I'm sure to anyone else it was like, "Yeah right."
         But I wanted, that was just something that I really enjoyed doing.
         That and dancing.
         I wanted to be a ballerina.
         The ballerina part never came about, but I, I did go on to college and I, um, transferred a lot and ended up going to a lot of different colleges which was kind of fun.
         I went to Marshall University, and I went to University of Pittsburgh, and I ended up graduating from West Virginia University with a major in printmaking and a minor in art history and English literature.
      
      
         Did you ever visit the Andy Warhol Museum in Pittsburgh?
         Because that is where he was, he grew up.
         And do, do you enjoy Andy Warhol?
      
      
         Well, you know, that's really funny, but I don't remember visiting the Andy Warhol Museum.
      
      
         Did you know that was where he was from?
      
      
         No.
         But I didn't, I studied Andy Warhol briefly.
         I mean I didn't go an in-depth study of him or that type of art.
      
      
         I think he took his first art lessons at Carnegie Museum-- \\
      
      
         \\ Carnegie Mellon.
         \\
      
      
         \\ Yeah, whatever, Carnegie.
         \\
      
      
         \\ Carnegie Mellon.
         \\
      
      
         When he was a kid and that's how he got interested in art.
      
      
         Um-hmm.
      
      
         But he, I think that his
         parents were Eastern European--
      
      
         Um-hmm.
      
      
         And they were like, lived in the nasty little section where all the mills were and stuff.
         But anyway.
         Um, who's your favorite artist?
      
      
         Well I really liked the Impressionists, I liked Monet and Renoir, Mary Cassatt, I, um, loved studying all of the artists.
         I loved art history.
         I loved Michelangelo's sculptures and his paintings and the Renaissance era.
         
         Rembrandt did the etchings and, you know, that was interesting to me because, you know, that's what I ended up doing, was printmaking.
         But I, I like the light and the pastels, colors that are in the Impressionists.
         
      
      
         What do you think about the current trends in art, modern art?
         Which some conservative people might consider offensive and disturbing?
         Especially the anti-religious art.
      
      
         Um-hmm, well art has always been controversial and has always reflected what is going on in the world.
         You know, and, um, so, you know, having studied art history, that doesn't, it doesn't shock me or surprise me that much.
         And I, you know, I don't like it, personally, because,
         you know, it does offend me, what, what I have seen, and I don't like the idea that we are giving the money to create extremely offensive art, but, um, again, that, that's, you know, is, art reflects what's going on and art is, is very spiritual regardless of whether its content says, you know, something about God or not, there, there has a very spiritual quality about it.
         It's very powerful
      
      
         Um, OK.
         I watched a special on Norman Rockwell the other night on PBS, and some consider him not an artist but just an illustrator.
         What are your comments on that?
      
      
         
         Well, that is a, a statement that I've heard used in art a lot.
         I, personally, I was accused of being an illustrator, which it's interesting that I would even use the word "accuse" because it seems like there is a lot of prejudice in art and of what people say is art with quotation marks around it.
         And, uh, Norman Rockwell was a tremendous artist.
         He was a, he was a, you know, he was a realist.
         And regardless of whether someone calls it illustrative or not.
         It, it is art and it is wonderful art and he has captured a whole era, you know, he captured people and, and people that, who you could look into their faces and you could tell everything about them.
         You know so, people in my field, in my experience, when I was in college, one of the things that I exp, you know, had to deal with, was other people's opinion of what art is, and especially my instructors saying, "You need to be more cryptic," or "You need to be more esoteric, your art is too transparent or too happy."
         You know, well that's me.
      
      
         ( ) All writers have to be suicidal in order to be considered brilliant, I'm so sick of that.
         Why does everyone have kill their selves or be moody, just to be considered a good writer or artist?
      
      
         Well one of the things the art world is looking for is, you know, um, emotion.
         They want an emotion to be evoked, you know, when you look at something.
         Art, art whether it's writing or, or, um, drama or visual or music, you know, there's a term that Shakespeare used.
         It was catharsis, you know, and people want to exper, they want to experience something.
         And I guess even in writing, um,
         , there's so many unhappy people in the world and it seems like, you know, when they read something and can relate to it then they get some kind of release or relief in their emotions by identifying with it and that could be why there seems to be such a demand for that sort of thing.
         And, uh, but, on the other hand, there's the happy people, you know, and I am one of them.
         I'm just a happy person, and my art reflects that, and I think that I, you know, love to read stories that are written and everything that also, you know, have a good moral background to them, and something where you can learn something of value and virtue in it, like Louisa May Alcott, you know, her work, I love her work.
         So, you know, there's two sides to that coin.
         We just have to find the right audience.
      
      
         OK, thank you for your comments, Linda.
         Again, her name's Linda Wentz and she's my step mom who lives a quick 45 minutes away from Charlotte in Lincolnton, NC.
      
   

   
   
      
         Female Voice TAPE 1, SIDE A
      
      
         This interview is Darlene Maurer interviewing Christopher Werth.
         Chris, can you tell us what stories or book you remember reading as a child?
      
      
         Probably the most, uh, well-known books would be the, uh, uh, a series of books called, uh, Meet, and then it would give a name.
         For example, Meet Andrew Jackson or Meet Daniel Boone or George Washington, uh, things like that.
      
      
         Why were they special?
      
      
         Well I was always interested in biography as a kid, um, so I guess because they told me about things, people, personalities.
         I've always had, had an interest in history, so it was a chance to learn more about people.
      
      
         So it's, uh, it's the history, historical part and learning about the historical people that interested you the most?
      
      
         Probably the biography, you know, the people and the times they lived in.
      
      
         And what age of child, what age of child were you?
      
      
         Umm, I don't know.
         I would probably say sometime between, maybe, uh, five and eight.
      
      
         Wow that young of an age you were interested in other people, huh?
      
      
         Oh yeah.
         I've always been interested.
         It's a, it was a good way to find out what was going on outside the world that I was living in.
      
      
         So do you remember any particular ones that you really liked, or anyone?
      
      
         No.
         I think they were just all interesting books, uh, you know, I had a whole collection them and I only got rid of them when I was in high school.
         Now I hear they're pretty valuable books.
         
         As usually the case.
      
      
         Yeah.
         That happens, yes.
      
      
         But, um, you know, they were interesting and they talked about the, not just the famous persons, but they also talked about, um, you know, the times they lived in and things like that.
         Pretty nicely illustrated,-
      
      
         Uh-huh.
         OK.
         \\ Did you have-\\
      
      
         \\ -easy to read.
         \\.
      
      
         -special feelings when you read them, or-?
      
      
         Just tried to imagine what life was like in those times.
      
      
         Oh I see, so you would like-
      
      
         
            
         
      
      
         -go into the imagination, go into the imagination of-
      
      
         Yeah.
      
      
         -this is what it must have been like being this person or living at that time or-
      
      
         Yeah, or knowing some things.
      
      
         -something like that?
      
      
         Yeah.
      
      
         So, OK.
         Um, anything else you can remember about that?
      
      
         No.
         Just, just generally.
      
      
         OK.
         So where, uh, was this?
         Was this-?
      
      
         Um, between, well home was NJ and Raleigh.
         New Jersey and Raleigh, NC.
      
      
         OK.
         
         So, um
         , anything else you can think of for us?
      
      
         No.
         I just think they were just fairly well-illustrated, you know.
         Simple to read compared to some of the other stuff I was reading.
         But they were pretty simple to read.
      
      
         Oh, OK.
         Can you remember some, uh, any other stories that you might have read or stories your family, someone maybe in your family, told you?
      
      
         Um-
         
            
         
      
      
         Hi.
      
      
         Hi
         .
         Do you need the room?
      
      
         Yeah.BREAK
      
      
         Can you think of any stories that, um, that you remember from growing up or anyone in the family telling you?
         Anyone in your family telling stories?
      
      
         The only story I might remember would be, um, as I got older, um, you know, asking folks what it was like, uh, living in France during the Nazi occupation, what it was like growing up before that, and that type of thing.
      
      
         So your parents came over here?
      
      
         My father did in `16.
      
      
         OK.
      
      
         After the Second World War.
      
      
         Your mom was born here then?
      
      
         My mom was born here.
         So maybe asking her what it was like growing up in New York City before WW II or during the War, or that type of thing.
      
      
         Oh, I see.
      
      
         But as rule, storytelling was not something that I grew up with like some traditions and some cultures and some places there were-
      
      
         Right.
      
      
         -you tell stories about things, you have to ask for those, that information.
      
      
         Right.
      
      
         Maybe because the memories were so pitifully painful.
      
      
         Right.
         Was it difficult?
         Do they, do they, uh, share about what their homeland was like?
         What France was like?
      
      
         Dad doesn't talk too much about what life was like, other than talking about how good times were before the War.
         But during the War he doesn't, he's got, a lot of stuff has been blocked out.
      
      
         Um.
      
      
         Because I imagine that life was pretty tough.
         Mom remembers a lot of stuff, but, uh, you know, details of everyday life, but, uh, she also remembers a lot about the Great Depression and then the rationing during the Second World War and things like that, but she doesn't go into much detail either.
      
      
         Uh-huh.
      
      
         It must of have been pretty hard.
         That's all I can think-
      
      
         Yeah.
      
      
         -since it wasn't talked about.
      
      
         Yeah.
      
      
         Or still isn't talked about unless you pry it out of them.
      
      
         Uh-huh.
      
      
         And even then you don't get a full story.
      
      
         Uh-huh.
         Do they ever talk about good memories they had back then?
      
      
         Uh, they have some good memories but it's just not talked about, period.
      
      
         Um.
      
      
         Just, I, I didn't not grow up in a tradition where storytelling about life, you know, or heroics, uh, were talked about, or it just, you have to pry people's information, I guess, pull from their information.
      
      
         Um, just don't go there, huh?
      
      
         Yeah.
      
      
         Yeah, yeah, I understand.
      
      
         I know some people freely talked about their, about exploits, you know.
         That's just, that's just not part of the family tradition, I guess.
      
      
         Uh-huh.
         OK.
         Um, OK, all right.
         Is there anything else you'd like to say?
      
      
         No.
         Um, just that, um, you know, that as far as, you know, stories, you know, most of the stories I, you know, if I remember anything it's about the books I read and stuff.
         But oral storytelling is not part of, you know, as I say, the family tradition.
      
      
         Your family didn't talk much around the dinner table about stories?
      
      
         Well we talked about what happened during your day and, you know, what happened at school, what happened at work, but as a rule, um, and maybe that's because, for, you know, from the time I was 10, um, you know, I didn't have any cousins living nearby, and aunts and uncles, and grandparents.
      
      
         Oh, OK.
      
      
         So-
      
      
         So that really made a difference?
      
      
         Yeah.
         My mother's parents were both dead by that time, well before I was born, and so I never knew my mother's parents and there would have been stories, maybe, there.
      
      
         Right.
      
      
         Uh, when I was 10, I moved away from my grandfather, who already, uh, I think he was already dead by that time, and my grandmother was definitely, you know, way away and we didn't talk to her.
         Un, o, my father may have talked to her once a week on the phone.
      
      
         Where did she live?
      
      
         In NY, but we were in NC by this time so-
      
      
         OK, OK.
      
      
         So maybe, you know, it was just, you know, you know, when I would physically see her for a while, it was like once a year.
         But there was never any storytelling going on.
      
      
         Uh-huh.
      
      
         Until she got maybe much older, and then I started prying into the family history.
      
      
         Yeah.
      
      
         But that was only because I was doing a research project in which you talk about things.
      
      
         OK.
         So do you have brothers and sisters?
      
      
         I have one brother, younger.
      
      
         Uh-huh OK.
      
      
         No sisters.
      
      
         OK, good.
         Well, thank you for sharing your story with us.
      
      
         All right, thank you.
         Good luck on your project.
      
      
         Thanks.
      
   

   
   
      
         This is an interview with Tammy White.
         Where were you born?
      
      
         I was born in Charlotte.
      
      
         How long ago?
      
      
         Hmph, 38 years, 39 years ago.
         
         I was there for 30 years.
      
      
         So, you are a native Charlottean?
      
      
         Until I moved to Gaston County, which was seven or eight years ago.
      
      
         I guess you pretty well seen that town grow up.
      
      
         I still work in Charlotte.
         
         I still feel like I live there since Gaston County is only five minutes next door to Charlotte.
      
      
         What's changed the most about the city since you've been a child?
      
      
         ( )
      And add more.
         
         Didn't used to be so dangerous to drive and now it is very dangerous to drive.
         I don't think they should let kids drive anymore.
         Not until they're about 18, 19 years old.
         I think they should have a learners permit for a long time.
         
         We've had so many people move in from everywhere.
      
      
         I guess you don't even recognize Charlotte anymore it's changed so much.
      
      
         I recognize it because it changes with me each and everyday.
         Don't look like it used to.
         
      
      
         What where were you born in Charlotte?
      
      
         Presbyterian Hospital.
      
      
         That was in December, '60.
      
      
         
         Yeah.
         I was the first granddaughter born.
         There were a bunch of grandsons on both sides of the family.
         So I was named after each grandmother and Mama liked "Tammy" and stuck it in the middle.
         So I had a real long name when I went to school.
         I was in the first grade before I found out what my whole name was.
      
      
         What was your whole name?
      
      
         Christine Tammy Marie Watkins.
         I lay my head down on the desk and cried because I had to learn how to write a long name and everyone else's was short.
         I'd been writing "Tammy Watkins."
         
         I could read and write before I went to school, because Mama had a lot of time to spend with me.
         My next sister wasn't born until I was like five years old.
         [Long pause] The teachers were upset because I was way ahead of everybody else.
         
         They didn't know what to do with me.
      
      
         Like a misfit.
      
      
         And I got in trouble all the time.
         
         They still liked me though; they still helped me.
      
      
         What do you remember as a child?
         Tell me the story about the coat.
      
      
         Which one?
         The big furry blue coat?
      
      
         Yeah.
      
      
         That was like in the fifth grade, fourth grade.
         Blue was my favorite color.
         Everything I had was blue.
         So Mama and Daddy bought me a big blue furry coat for my birthday or Christmas.
         I don't know.
         Birthday and Christmas run together.
         Usually what I got for birthday was for Christmas and Christmas for birthday.
         Because my birthday was so close to Christmas I only got one present.
         It was a big old ugly blue fur coat.
         I felt like a big blue polar bear.
         So I hid it under the bushes on the way to the bus and pick it up on the way home.
         Same things kids do now, except they pick out their own coats.
         They just change their mind after a week.
         [Long pause] I was a tomboy.
         I only had boys to play with.
         
         When I was little I used to want to be a boy.
         
         When I grew up I wondered why?
         Why you want to be something that was so inhuman?
         
      
      
         Why do you say that?
      
      
         
         
         Well guy's are all right, as long as they're your friends.
         
         
         I still have more guy friends than girlfriends.
         Even after all these years.
         
      
      
         Remember anything else as a little child?
         
      
      
         
         Jumping off high buildings.
         Swinging a swing as far as it would go and jump out of it and see who could jump the farthest.
         Or, we'd take the swing and pull the swing out all the way around until it, until it dunked and we'd swing all the way around the top of it.
         We'd build playhouses out in the woods, tree houses out in the woods.
         We dig a, we dug an underground cavern out of the mud one time and stole a bunch of stuff from all the houses around.
         We had carpet in there, and rugs, and furniture and everything.
         We played in it a couple of years until the parents found out and then they had a fit, they said we could have smothered to death if it fell in or rained or anything.
         That was neat.
         You had to climb down in it.
         It looked real neat too it looked better than some of our houses.
         Dug it out little by little, made it bigger.
         Of course it probably wasn't as big as I remember it to be.
         
         I used to love to go up to my Aunt Sandra's house because she had three boys and she'd let us run wild through the neighborhood.
         When I was at home with, Mama and Daddy wouldn't even let me out of the yard.
         They watched me like a hawk.
         Sandra was scared to death when it was time for Mama to come pick me up because I'd be muddy and dirty from head to toe.
         
         Mama hated it that I was a tomboy.
         
         She always bought me dolls and everything.
         She knew I didn't want dolls.
         They'd just sit there in my room.
      
      
         What about them dogs?
         Hum?
      
      
         Oh the dogs.
         I don't, I don't really remember some of the dogs, but I remember more what she told me.
         I remember being and having the dogs all around.
         That was before Debbie was born.
         I was like three or four.
         And there's pictures, pictures of me with the dogs.
         Mama said there was like six dogs that run through the neighborhood.
         And she said, she was always playing with me, that, and she said she never worried about them hurting me.
         She said that I was up in a tree or something and she told me to come to her.
         
         And she started, started pulling me or something, I don't remember exactly, so the dogs circled her and snarled and growled at her and she got, backed back into the house.
         And I wouldn't come in because I knew I was going to get a whipping for climbing up in that tree.
         And later, I guess I forgot and she knew I would.
         I guess she bribed me to come in with some candy and, and then she tore my tail up.
         She said it still didn't stop me
      from hanging around with the dogs or anything she felt like they, because, protected me I could stay out in the yard for hours and she'd check on me like every 15 minutes and I was taken care of.
         She said nobody else would bother me either.
         Said never occurred to her that those dogs might hurt me but they never did.
         Said I always had a gift for animals
      I guess because I was never afraid of them.
         Now that I'm older I've grown afraid of them and they can tell it.
         
      
      
         What about your secret garden?
      
      
         Oh yeah.
         I was, when I was in junior high, in eighth grade.
      
      
         Hum.
         What happened?
      
      
         Went through, we'd ride bikes through the woods and everything.
         I loved to ride bikes.
         Rode bikes for a long time until I was a big old girl.
         And we went into the woods and there was bunch of vines that covered like a blanket.
         And I'd walk through those vines and it was real shady and cool.
         It'd be like 10 or 15 degrees cooler than it was outside.
         And there were big rocks and a nice creek, big giant rocks.
         I'd sit our there and read
      or whatever.
         It was just peaceful.
         And I took Mama out there one time and asked her if she'd spend the day with me.
         Just one time because she always worked she didn't have much time to spend with us.
         That was after she left Daddy.
         
         I got her a bicycle; I borrowed a bicycle for her.
         She pushed it most of the way.
         She couldn't ride it.
         It hurt her legs.
         I couldn't understand that.
         I thought it was a whole lot easier to ride that bike than walking.
         Fixed us a picnic lunch and she brought a book and we went out there.
         And she still talks about that.
         She really liked it.
         She said it was really just as beautiful as I always said it was.
         It's gone now.
      
      
         Bulldozed over.
         A new project slapped up.
      
      
         I don't know who it belonged to.
         It was out behind the houses.
      
      
         That was over on Arrowood Road.
      
      
         No that was, um, that was in Huntersville.
         When Mama left Daddy we went and moved out to Huntersville.
      
      
         Oh.
      
      
         For a little while.
         We used to go in the woods back by, back off Arrowood Road.
         I lived in Windsong Trail that's right across the street when we lived on Arrowood Road.
         We didn't move very far that time.
         We'd go out there and pick blackberries and sell them, out in the woods.
         I had a friend of mine, he huffed a can of ( ) and died when he was camping out.
         And uh, one of his guys, buddies that was with him just got sick and ended up in the hospital.
         [Long pause] I think everybody cried.
         
         He was a popular boy.
      
      
         Kids just don't know how easy it is to die.
      
      
         Well so huffing is nothing new, they did it when I was kid.
         I didn't hear about it as much then as I do now though.
         
         And boy he'd take up for, um, all the underdogs.
         So a lot of people were sad.
         
         I hung around with, uh, one girl and, um, two guys and then later we, uh, had another girl join our group.
         I hung around with them boys from the fourth grade on up to through to high school.
         But when Mama left Daddy and everything and we moved away and then moved back I still went to school with them.
         
         Kenny, Kenny, huh
      .
         He died not too long ago on a motorcycle.
      
      
         Didn't you go up in the mountains for a summer or something, with your aunt?
      
      
         Yeah.
         One week out of the summer, every year.
      
      
         \\Where they live\\?
      
      
         \\ ( )\\ They lived in, um, Black Mountain for a long time and then they moved to ( ) another mountain.
      
      
         That's in NC?
      
      
         Uh huh.
         
      
      
         So you never did leave the state, did you?
      
      
         Um uh.
      
      
         I know Earl use to take y'all to the beach didn't he?
      
      
         Yeah, we went every weekend to the beach.
         That was the highlight.
         We went to the beach every weekend.
         Go fishing at the pier.
         
      
      
         What did you do up in the mountains?
      
      
         Everything.
      
      
         Did you make a quilt?
      
      
         No.
      
      
         Did you churn butter?
      
      
         No.
         They were more modern up there than we were down here.
         
         My aunt and uncle were teachers and principals.
         She had a boy that was about Debbie's age.
         And she'd take me to, uh, not, not every year, but there were some years she'd take me to a day camp because she wanted me to play with kids my age and she didn't have any.
         And she'd take me out shopping and buy me all kind of new clothes.
         She wanted a little girl
      and I was it.
         Because all my boy cousins got to go up there and stay every summer too for a week.
         And she said they about run her crazy.
         She said I was the only slow time she got.
         She said I'd help her and everything and I enjoyed helping her.
         Went to the library.
      
      
         Did you ever go horseback riding or anything?
      
      
         Yes.
         
         I didn't go horseback riding up in the mountains.
         Mama paid for my lessons down here in Charlotte.
         And then she couldn't pay for them anymore so I started working in the stables to continue then.
         It was English, English style, back riding.
         
         I used to skip school during junior high and steal a pony and return it and go back home.
         Did that a lot.
         [Long pause]
      
      
         Remember anything else as a
      child?
      
      
         I remember a lot of things I'm just not going to put it on this tape.
         
         
         Then my children will hear it and then try to pull it too.
         
         I'm still friends with some of my high school, elementary school and junior high friends.
         I see them about once every six months or a year.
         Some more often than that.
      
      
         Who was your best friend?
      
      
         Well, Kenny and Billy were my best friends until I met Angie.
         Angie, was, I've known Angie as long as Kenny and Billy, but she was more into boys for other reasons than what I was and I was just not mature enough for boys yet except to play with.
         So she kind of bored me.
         She ended up having like six kids later with three or four different guys.
         I really don't know.
      
      
         So I guess you haven't talked to her in a long time.
      
      
         Not since um, I had Justin.
         I seen her the last time when I had Justin.
         Not since Marshall was born.
         Worked at BP Oil on Park Rd.
         , she used to come in there all the time.
         That was on the south side of town.
         We were raised on the south side of town.
      
      
         That side sure has grown up hasn't it?
      
      
         There are still parts over there I still don't recognize.
      
   

   
   
      
         This is an interview with Justin Lee White, son of Tammy White, grandson of Flora Miller.
         
         What do you remember as a young child?
         Since you're a young child it should be fresh in your mind right now.
         Justin?
      
      
         Um.
         
         I don't know.

         Almost your whole life.

         Yeah.
         So, what used to be over there?

         All right.
         Didn't you have a little house underneath them vines?

         We did all kinds of stuff.

         Yeah.
         Oh wow, all what, what we did was we climbed them trees and we got um, and we tore down limbs and stuff and added to them, added to the club

         Um-huh.
         That table.
      
      
         What about the trampoline?
      
      
         Yeah we had a trampoline.
      
      
         What could you do on it?
      
      
         Back flips.
      
      
         Back flips?
         What else?
      
      
         Um.
         Front flips.
         
         Sideways.
         
      
      
         Tell me a story.
      
      
         A story about what?
      
      
         About jumping off a tree house onto the trampoline.
      
      
         About jumping off the tree house onto the trampoline or something.
      
      
         I used to do a back flip off of it.
         And I can do a front flip, but I land on my stomach.
         [Long pause]
      
      
         Did your mom want you jumping off the trampoline?
      
      
         Nope, uh um.
      
      
         Did you stop?
      
      
         Uh um.
         
      
      
         What you like more, school or getting out for summer?
      
      
         Getting out for the summer.
         
         But what I like more now is going to school.
      
      
         That's good.
         Do you like your teachers?
      
      
         Um huh.
         Back then or now?
      
      
         Anytime you want to think about talking about your teachers, you go right ahead.
         Tell me about your teacher from last year.
         You've been with her all year, you can tell me things about her.
      
      
         Her name--
      
      
         What was her name?
      
      
         Ms. Townsend.
      
      
         Ms. Townsend.
         Was she a good teacher?
      
      
         Yeah.
         She was loud though.
      
      
         She was loud?
         Did you learn a lot from her?
      
      
         Um-huh.
      
      
         Then she's a good teacher isn't she?
         Because a good teacher teaches you something, right?
      
      
         Um-huh, and the year before that I had Ms. Smitton was it, and she was even louder.
      
      
         She was?
         Was she a good teacher?
      
      
         Yeah.
         
      
      
         Why were they all so loud?
      
      
         I don't know.
      
      
         Because you were so noisy?
      
      
         Um-huh.
      
      
         Well, what you do this year?
         Who's your teacher?
      
      
         Miss Sanger.
      
      
         Miss who?
      
      
         Miss Sanger.
      
      
         Miss Sanger, this year?
      
      
         Yep.
         Yep.
         Yep.
         
      
      
         Do you like her?
      
      
         Yep.

         Right.
      
   

   
   
      
         This is a conversation between Denise Slavich and her mother, Fran Worthington, on February 16, year 2000.
         And Mom, what, what would you like to talk about today?
      
      
         Oh, when I was a little girl.
         And we'll begin at the beginning.
         I was born on May 3rd, 1937, which was shortly after the end of the Depression.
         My mother, your grandmother, was 36 years old and your grandfather, my father, was 45.
         And I was an only child, the reason being that, I know now, she was probably an RH Negative person because she had had one child stillborn, three years before I was born and miscarried in her seventh or eighth month, when I was, uh, six years before I was born.
         So the doctors told her she should never, ever try to have another child.
         And her comment was, "Watch me!"
      
      
         
            
         
      
      
         So, she kept trying and got pregnant with me, and carried me to full term and so, since she was, and my dad were both much older, I was a terribly spoiled brat.
      
      
         
            
         
      
      
         Because I was their only child and they knew I was going to be their only child and, within reason, I got just about anything I wanted that they could afford, I got.
      
      
         Oh wow!
      
      
         But, um, being an only child was sort of a lonely life, but it was interesting, because I spent a lot of time with grown-ups.
         And my mother was, never, ever knew her father.
         He died about three months before she was born.
         He was a railroad engineer, and he was working on the, down on the Pee Dee River in SC and got malaria and died.
      
      
         I never knew that.
      
      
         Yeah.
         So my grandmother, whose name was Frances, raised her children all by herself.
         My mother, whose name was Julius, she was named for her father since he died.
         Her name was Julius, which in, I mean which was not a woman's name.
      
      
         Right.
      
      
         Her name was Julius Wellington Culbreth.
      
      
         That's a very masculine name.
      
      
         Yeah, exactly.
         And she was the youngest of three girls.
         And, um, then my grandmother died when I was three years old, so I never really, really knew her.
         But everyone called her Mama Frank.
      
      
         Huh.
      
      
         And that's where I got the name, \\"Mama Fran"\\ for the grandchildren to call me.
      
      
         Oh!
         I never knew that!
      
      
         Yeah.
         And I didn't think about it until the grandchildren started coming along and we were thinking about what to call people and it suddenly popped in my mind, that's what my grandmother's name was, Mama Frank.
         And I was named Frances Jeanette for both of my grandmothers.
         My father's mother was Jeanette, and she was, had died long before I was born.
         And neither one of my grandfathers were alive.
         So I never had any grandparents.
         And I really missed that.
         And my dad was the, the, uh, next to the youngest of 11 children.
         So since he was 45 when I was born, all my first cousins had children older than I was.
      
      
         
            
         
      
      
         So I would go out and see my second cousins, not my first cousins because they were all old people as far as I was concerned.
         But when I was, I think one of my earliest recollections, was when I was three years old, Mama and Daddy and I went down to, to FL.
         And I remember, going through the lobby of the hotel where we stayed at with my bathing suit on and with one of those God-awful swim caps that everybody that you see when you look in the 40s movies and it felt like I was in a vacuum when I was walking!
         I could hear my feet in my ears!
         Going clunk, clunk, clunk!
      
      
         Was it one of the swim caps with the flowers?
      
      
         No it didn't have flowers, just the swim caps with the, the strap that hooked all the way under.
         And no matter what you did, your hair still got wet!
      
      
         
            
         
      
      
         I think you were supposed to be totally vacuum-proof and all that stuff!
         But it still got wet.
         But that's one of the memories I have of walking across the lobby of the hotel and going clunk, clunk, clunk as I was walking across and then going swimming.
         And another memory I have is, my mother had a terrible, severe sinus condition.
         So every summer, up until I was, probably six or seven, we spent the entire summer down at, at, uh, Carolina Beach.
         And I would get so tan!
         I mean I would just get absolutely, totally dark brown!
         And my mother would say to me, "Frances Jeanette!
         If you get any darker, they're going to make you sit in the back of the bus!"
      
      
         Oh my gosh!
      
      
         Because that was when segregation was still on and at the, uh, department stores, they had separate water fountains and separate bathrooms for colored and white.
         And when you rode on a bus, the colored had to sit in the back and the white people sat in the front.
      
      
         How did that feel?
         I mean seeing that happen?
      
      
         Normal.
         Because it was the way things were.
         I mean, that's just the way it was.
      
      
         Wow!
      
      
         And we had, a, a, uh, a colored maid who came, gosh, about twice a week, whose name was Carrie.
         And she was just like my other mother.
         She, she bathed me and played with me and took care of me.
         Even then when my mother died, she came to the funeral.
         I mean, she was just like a member of the family.
      
      
         Wow!
      
      
         But um, let's see.
         When I was four?
         1941, yeah, was when they had Pearl Harbor.
      
      
         Uh-huh.
      
      
         And since we lived in Fayetteville, they decided to immediately expand Fort Bragg.
         So, um, we lived on Fort Bragg Rd, which, at that point, was the only road between Fayetteville and Fort Bragg.
         And with all the added construction and all that, from six in the morning until nine, it was bumper-to-bumper traffic on this little two-lane road going to Fort Bragg.
      
      
         Wow.
      
      
         From four o'clock until seven, coming back, it was bumper-to-bumper traffic, coming back from Fort Bragg.
      
      
         
            
         
      
      
         So, you couldn't cross the street, you couldn't turn in or turn out or anything, it was just really, really crazy, because they were doing such incredible construction out there.
         And I remember all the headlights on all the cars were painted black for the first half, the first, the top semi-circle was black so that when if you went out at night, the light would shine just down on the road and not straight ahead.
         Everybody had window shades, you didn't have blinds back then, but everybody had window shades that were blackout shades and you had to pull them down at night before you turned on any of the lights, because everyone was deathly afraid that the Germans or the Japanese were going to come bomb us.
         Not that they ever did or--
      
      
         \\
         \\
      
      
         \\ --I don't think \\ they ever planned on it, but everyone was quite sure that that was going to happen.
      
      
         Looking back it almost seems silly.
      
      
         Yeah, it does but yet, yet there's, they have found evidence that there were, um, uh, submarines off the coast down in Wilmington.
      
      
         Right.
      
      
         But um, you know, we were all pretty, pretty much panicked.
         And everyone, when you got chewing gum, you saved the aluminum wrapper.
         It was waxed paper with aluminum on the outside.
         You always peeled off the aluminum and made great big balls for, that was the earliest recycling.
      
      
         
            
         
      
      
         Everyone saved all their tin cans, um, and crushed them and put, took them to be recycled and be reused.
         There was rationing of gas, um, sugar, flour, any of, of the real, uh, staple things that a lot of people would use a lot of if they could.
         And you had a, it looked like a book of S&H green stamps.
         You got a booklet of stamps every month and several pages would be for gas, and several pages would be for flour or for butter or for, um, sugar, and you could only use X number of stamps to buy whatever you wanted to buy that, that month and then you had to wait until the next month.
         And since your dad, your, your grandfather worked for the post office, this was a critical job because he had to get the mail in and out, and he got an extra ration of gas because he had to drive back and forth to work.
      
      
         Oh, wow!
      
      
         So that was pretty special.
      
      
         Yeah.
         Now did you notice, did you have a wanting of things during that time?
      
      
         No, no.
         We had, um, we had chickens, your dad, your grandfather raised chickens, and uh, we'd always get them at Easter, well you know, dyed pink and blue and green and all that sort of thing.
         I'd get the little biddies and they'd become full-grown chickens and, uh, your grandmother would gather the eggs and sold them to a lot of her neighbors.
         We had, uh, I mean we didn't, I didn't know that I was supposedly being deprived of stuff because there was plenty to have because we had all, all of your grandfather's brothers and sisters had farms, we were the only ones that lived in the city, or the town of Fayetteville, it was the big city.
      
      
         
            
         
      
      
         But we'd go out and get ham and, uh, beef and, you know all that kind of thing from them.
         Sausage and pork chops and so forth and such, and any kind of fresh vegetables, so we always had food.
         And your granddaddy had a huge garden in the back and he grew, never could grow carrots, they were always awful, but he grew potatoes and collards, spinach and green beans, and those yellow crook-necked squash.
      
      
         Right.
      
      
         You remember those.
      
      
         The squash and potatoes recipe.
      
      
         Exactly.
      
      
         
            
         
      
      
         So he, he had a very successful garden and he'd go to work at probably six o'clock in the morning and he'd be home by four in the afternoon.
         He'd go out and work in the garden until dark.
         So we really didn't, I mean I wasn't aware of, of, wanting for anything.
      
      
         Except for the piano lessons.
      
      
         Oh, well, yeah because we, there was gas rationing.
         Well, to back up, when I was just learning to walk, your grandmother and grandfather told me that when we'd go down to the beach and spend the summer at the beach, back then there was no air conditioning whatsoever, and so all the, the bars and the stores and everything on the boardwalks would have screened-in, screened doors on the front.
         And any place we'd go by when I was walking with them, I'd have my hands up in the air and they'd be holding either hand--
      
      
         
            
         
      
      
         --and when we'd go by any place that had a juke box playing, I had to stop and jog up and down in time to the music.
         When I was little bitty, so they knew I loved music.
         And my mother sang in the choir, and uh, in fact that's where she met Leola.
         She and Leola best friends-- first and second altos and all that, but she knew I'd probably love music, and when I first learned to walk, she said I'd walk over to the piano and reach way up and start playing the keys.
         And I never would bang; I'd play one key at a time, with one finger.
      
      
         
            
         
      
      
         And she'd put me up on the piano bench and would know for at least 30 or 45 minutes exactly where I was because I was sitting there playing the piano.
         So when I was four, all my little friends were going take, ballet and tap dance lessons and I wanted to, but they encouraged me to play
         take piano lessons because the piano teacher lived right around the corner and the dance teacher was all the way on the other side of town, where her dance studio was.
         So, for fifty cents and hour, I took piano lessons.
         And I went around once a week, because I could walk.
         She, Mother would cross the street with me and then I could walk to the piano teacher, whose name was, oh gosh, what was her name?
         Dorothy Russell.
         And she taught for years and years.
         I took from her until I was 15.
      
      
         Wow.
      
      
         And I think she taught just about everybody in town who wanted to learn to play the piano because she had, she had this
         I never will forget, she had this great big Chow dog, the one, the kind with the black tongue, and I was petrified of that dog!
      
      
         
            
         
      
      
         She always kept him in the backyard, so I never went in the backyard.
         I'd always go in the front door there instead of going around to the back.
         I hadn't thought about that until just now, for a long time.
         But it was, it was fun playing the piano, and I, and then when I was six, no when I was five
         the next year, I was actually in the recital.
         And I couldn't play any pieces that, where the notes spanned an octave because my fingers weren't long enough until I was about nine.
      
      
         
            
         
      
      
         But I was in the recital and, every time, every year, it seemed like before, right before recital time I'd be out playing with somebody and fall down and skin my knees.
         And mother would make this great big, fancy dress with a real full, fluffy skirt, and she'd make a bow to match to wear on my hair, and I'd have Mercurochrome scabs on both knees.
      
      
         
            
         
      
      
         So, she always would get real upset with me with that, but that's life.
         Because since I didn't have any brothers or sisters to play with, we lived right next door to Westlawn Elementary School, and when I started school, the bell would start ringing and I could leave the house and run across the playground and get there before it stopped.
         So I was never late.
         But I'd come home from school every afternoon and sit down and had to practice the piano for an hour, and then people would knock on the door and they'd say, "Mrs. Williams, can Frances come out to play?"
         And she'd say, "No, there, she's practicing her piano.
         Wait for another hour and then she can."
         But I played out on the, on the playground because we had swings and we had tennis courts, and, up until I was about 12, I played tackle football.
         And we had basketball goals and I played basketball with the guys, which was detrimental because at that point when you, girls basketball rules were different from boys.
         Instead of five players we had six.
         And there were three guards and three forwards.
         The guards could not cross the centerline and the forwards could not come back across the centerline either.
      
      
         Hmm.
      
      
         So you'd get the, if you were a guard, you'd get the ball and dribble.
         You had to stop at the centerline and pass it over to a forward, which was very unwieldy!
         Now they, I mean, I forget when they changed the rules, but finally they started playing by boys ' rules.
      
      
         So when you played with the boys that would mess you up for playing with the girls?
      
      
         Yeah.
         Well, I much preferred playing with the boys because I liked to dribble all the way around and go up for a lay-up or something.
      
      
         Right.
      
      
         And I was, since I was tall, they always liked for, to have me on their team.
         But uh, that, that was fun, and, let's see--
      
      
         What did you guys, in, in, in your family, with a, with Grandma and Granddaddy, I mean, what kind of trips did you take when you were little?
      
      
         Oh, let's see, one time we went up to, oh, to the Skyline Dr. We went up, I re--, something, when I was about four, I think.
         We went up, your dad, your grandfather, was trying desperately to get back in the army.
         He wanted to serve and do his duty.
         He had been in WWI but he wanted to get back into the army.
         And he was 50 at this point in time, or 51.
         And we went down to Atlanta for him to talk to people down there and they told him that they couldn't do anything so if he really wanted to be in the army he needed to come back and go up to the Pentagon.
         So we drove up to Washington, and he went to the Pentagon and tried really hard for them to take him back and they said that what he was doing with the post office was in the best interest of the government and the country and he could serve much better by getting the mail to the soldiers.
         So they told him, "No," but while we were up there, it was Easter weekend and I rolled Easter eggs on the White House lawn.
      
      
         Wow.
      
      
         And that was, that was when, uh, Roosevelt was president, and he and Mrs. Roosevelt came out and shook hands with all of us.
         All the children.
         It was really, it was an interesting experience.
      
      
         Oh, I bet.
      
      
         And then coming back, we came back through Roanoke, VA and then were on the Skyline Drive, and Daddy said, "We're going to go to Roanoke and there's Roanoke Mountain there."
         Or Roan Mountain, anyway, there's supposed to be a mountain right in the middle of Roanoke.
         So I was thinking, having looked at all my books, school books, that it was going to be like the Rockies.
      
      
         
            
         
      
      
         --with snow and, you know, crags, a, and rocks and all that sort of thing.
         And I was so disappointed when we got there because we drove up and up and I said, "Well where's the mountain Daddy?"
         And he said, "We're on it," and it was, of course, covered with trees and there were no rocks and there was no snow--
      
      
         
            
         
      
      
         --and I was so disappointed.
         It just really burst my bubble.
         
            RECORDING PAUSED THEN CONTINUED
      
      
         Well since we were interrupted by the phone, now we're continuing.
      
      
         Yes.
      
      
         Um
         let's see, where were we?
      
      
         We were driving up Roan Mountain.
      
      
         Yeah, but then we, after we left Roanoke, we did get on the Skyline Drive and it was absolutely a beautiful, view, but there just weren't any mountains with rocks on them.
         So, that was one of the trips we took.
         A lot of times
         most, I guess most of the traveling we did was from Fayetteville down to the beach.
      
      
         Right, to Carolina Beach?
      
      
         To Carolina Beach.
         Every summer.
         And that was fun.
         And, uh, oh!
         I've got to tell you
         .
         Remember the, the birthmark I have on my leg?
         (Looks for birthmark) It's that little brown spot.
         
         Well, where is it?
      
      
         
            
         
      
      
         Anyway, I have a birthmark on my leg.
      
      
         I think I remember.
      
      
         Yeah, it's just a little brown
         right there.
         (Points to birthmark)
      
      
         Yeah, yeah.
      
      
         My mother told me that it was a Coca-Cola mark.
      
      
         \\ A Coca-Cola mark?
         \\
      
      
         \\ Because \\ when she was pregnant with me, she and Daddy would go down to the beach, because, again for her sinus condition, the salt air was really good for her, and she said that Daddy would not stop because she wanted to stop and get a Coca-Cola and he wouldn't stop.
         
         And she held her hands right behind her knees, I don't know why, but just in anxiety or something so he would stop and get her a Coke.
         So she swears that little mark is a Coca-Cola mark.
         And that may be why I like Coca-Cola so well.
      
      
         You inherited the addiction?
      
      
         Yeah, yeah, I guess I did.
         But, um, growing up in Fayetteville was fun.
         It was a small town that's grown a lot since then, but we had a lot of fun with all my friends riding bicycles and, just hanging out together.
         They'd come over and we'd just hang out in the driveway and, roller- skate or play with their dogs or whatever.
         I had a little dog, a toy terrier named Fifi.
      
      
         I never knew of Fifi.
      
      
         Yeah, I got Fifi when I was, gosh, four or five, and that poor dog was one
         I put her through so much!
         I'd dress her up in doll clothes--
      
      
         
            
         
      
      
         --and make her ride in, in the doll carriage, and I'd pick her up, with her front paws and make her dance with me, and we'd walk all over the place.
         I mean, she just, she was my companion because I didn't have brothers or sisters.
         And, but the only time I was really, really, um, lonely was the year that we had the polio epidemic.
         And that started, I think that was in, gosh, '46 or '47, and, uh, everybody was quarantined.
         You couldn't go, children could not go downtown, and, and this was long before Salk ever did the vaccine and with the polio epidemic, when people got Polio they had to be put in iron lungs that would breathe for them.
      
      
         Oh, wow.
      
      
         You may have seen pictures of them.
      
      
         I've heard of it.
      
      
         They were, they were great big, uh, metal tubes that opened, uh, and the only thing you could see was, uh, your head and your feet.
      
      
         Oh, wow.
      
      
         And it was pressurized so it would make you breathe in and out because they really were paralyzed.
         They called it Infantile Paralysis, or polio.
         But anyway, everybody was quarantined, we could, children had, could not go out of their own yard, they
         we couldn't go to church, couldn't go to movies, we couldn't go anywhere.
         We could ride in the car.
         I could ride in the car with, with Mother and Daddy, we'd go for a Sunday afternoon drive or something, but, I had nobody to play with.
         But fortunately, there was a, another only child girl who lived right across the street from us.
         So, her name was Joy Teeter, and she would come out on the sidewalk with her dolls and I'd come out on the sidewalk with my dolls, and we'd play dolls together across the street from each other!
      
      
         
         Across the street!
      
      
         Yeah.
      
      
         Oh, that's so sweet!
      
      
         Yeah.
         And we'd also, we'd draw hopscotch things on the, the sidewalk and play hopscotch together, and, you know, just any kind of little games we could devise.
         And we did, we'd do that for a couple hours a day.
      
      
         Wow.
      
      
         And that was our only contact with any other child.
      
      
         How long were you quarantined?
      
      
         
         I think, it started right after school was out in May, and until school started the following September.
      
      
         Was it scary, any time you would get the sniffles, or--?
      
      
         No, I was always healthy, so nothing happened, but several people in, in town did get polio and, and had to spend time in the Iron Lung as they called it.
      
      
         Did they recover or, was it fatal?
      
      
         I think they all recovered, but a couple of them had a, a recur, recurring touch of paralysis.
         Um, you know, one boy, in particular, I remember, had a, always had a limp after that.
      
      
         Wow.
      
      
         So, it was, it was scary.
         And, of course, I think the pa, the parents panicked more than the children did.
         
         We were just pissed off
         because we couldn't go play with anybody else or see anybody or anything.
         That, that's the only time I really, really regretted being an only child.
      
      
         What did your parents do during that time, I mean, to make it more fun for you, or--?
      
      
         Oh, bought me lots of coloring books and, uh, Mother made clothes for my baby dolls and uh, we'd, like I said, we'd go for rides, it was a long way out from Fayetteville to Fort Bragg at the point in time, and now there's, you know, they, they're, have the same, uh, boundary, but we'd ride out and listen to, on every Sunday afternoon, the army band had a band concert.
      
      
         Like at South Park.
      
      
         Yeah, like at South Park.
         And we'd ride out and I'd have to stay in the car, but we'd ride out and Daddy would park and we'd roll down the windows so I could hear the band.
         And obviously we didn't, nobody had TV, it wasn't
         nobody had it at that point in time, so I listened to the radio a lot.
         There were, uh, The Lone Ranger and all those serial programs.
         The, The Green Hornet, and The Phantom, and Big John and Sparky, and Amos and, and Andy, and uh, Fibber McGee and Molly, and--.
         
         There were a lot of radio shows, um, uh, oh shoot, what's his name, the guy that just died not recently, not too long ago, the uh, the comic, the one who did Oh God--
      
      
         Oh, um--
      
      
         (Long pause) George Burns.
      
      
         George Burns.
      
      
         George Burns and Gracie Allen.
         They had a show.
         So there were a lot of radio shows, and I, I read a lot.
      
      
         What, yeah, what, what would you read?
      
      
         Oh, all the Nancy Drew books, and all the um, I read a lot of sports books about football and baseball, and Mother would go to the library and just bring home a whole stack of them.
         So I did a lot of reading, and, uh, playing out in the yard, I'd help, when Daddy would come home, I'd help him out in the garden.
         So, I, I really didn't lack for things to do but they just were sort of lonely things.
      
      
         Right.
         How did your mom feel about, you being a tomboy?
      
      
         She
         , well, she said I was her little girl and I was, I was Daddy's little boy.
      
      
         
            
         
      
      
         --or little "tomboy", because he taught me how to, he was, he was sort of a jack-of-all-trades, so he did a lot of, he built, when we had the chickens, he built the chicken houses.
         He'd bring home all the two-by-fours and the siding and the shingles and stuff, and he'd build them all himself.
         And I'd help him.
         I'd hold the ladder or whatever.
         And then I, graduated to nailing this and that and sawing this and that and so forth.
         And one time he was building a, a chicken house and I said, "Daddy, that would make a great playhouse for me."
      
      
         
            
         
      
      
         And so, instead of putting it up on stilts, like he did the chicken houses, he made it into a little playhouse.
      
      
         Ooh!
      
      
         It had a door that opened and shut and locked.
         It had, uh, a window in the front, had a front porch, had a window that went up and down in the front, and a window that went up and down in the back.
         And had shelves and, it was a pretty interesting little playhouse, and I'd go, I kept all my dolls and stuff out there and I'd go out there and play for hours, and all my, friends would come over and we'd have such fun, and we'd had a couple of little rocking chairs and we sat out on the front porch.
      
      
         Oh, that's sweet.
      
      
         It was, it was a neat little playhouse.
         When we sold the house, the people that bought it had children, and they were just delighted because they had somewhere for their kids to play.
         And something else you probably don't know
         .
         The house that we lived in on Fort Bragg Road, was, um, very modern for it's time and had two bathrooms.
      
      
         Wow.
      
      
         And not too many houses built back then had two.
         But it was a two-story house, and on the front, on the first level, you'd come in the front door.
         On the left was a living room with a fireplace.
         On the right was a dining room and there were stairs going upstairs between that.
         And behind the dining room was a little, small room that they called a breakfast room, which was just because they had a wall between that and the kitchen.
         And there was a kitchen.
         Behind the living room was another room that we could, today we call them `dens,' but back then they called them, `sitting rooms.
         ' Then it had a wrap-around, um, screened-in porch--
      
      
         Uh-huh.
      
      
         --and a bathroom between the sitting room and the kitchen was a bathroom and also the door to the stairs to go down to the basement, because we had a coal-fired furnace.
         And then upstairs there were two huge rooms, one on either side of the house and a bath at the top of the stairs.
         So when they completed all the, um, building out at Fort Bragg and brought in so many troops, every Sunday when we went to church, Mother and Daddy would bring home at least one, and usually two, GIs who were there in their uniforms and looked very forlorned; they would bring them home for Sunday dinner.
      
      
         Oh that's nice!
      
      
         And finally, um, Daddy converted the whole upstairs into two efficiency apartments.
         So one bedroom had a stove and a refrigerator and they had to share the bath.
         And, well, each, each of the bedrooms had the separate stove and refrigerator and they shared a bath.
         And we would rent them to couples who were just going to be there while their husbands were going through training.
         And that was interesting!
         So
         they turned the, the dining room into Mama and Daddy's bedroom and the breakfast room was my bedroom--
      
      
         Wow.
      
      
         --which was just about big enough for a bed and that was about it.
         But that was fun for me because I had somebody else to talk to.
      
      
         Uh-huh.
      
      
         And a couple of, of the families that lived there had a couple of children, if you could imagine four people sleeping, sleeping in one room.
      
      
         That would be tight!
      
      
         It was!
         It was necessary because the guys were going off to war and the, their wives didn't know when or if they would ever see them again.
      
      
         Uh-huh.
      
      
         So they absolutely thought that every minute was precious.
         And for years and years afterwards we heard from these people.
         The sent Christmas cards and would write--
      
      
         Oh.
      
      
         It was just really nifty.
         And, um, something else I remember was, and you've probably seen this in the movies.
         Everybod y who had someone in the service had a star in their window so you'd always know.
         And then if, I think there were with a cer, a certain color, maybe a red background, and if, if the, the military member was liked, it became a white background.
         Something like that: I can't remember which colors there were, but there was a distinction.
      
      
         Yeah.
         I've heard of yellow ribbons.
      
      
         No.
         That was way longer
         , that was, "Tie a Yellow Ribbon `Round the--"
      
      
         
            Right.
      
      
         That was a long time after that.
         But everybody had
         , they called them `Victory Stars' or `Service Stars.
         ' And if you see any movies that were, well in, Saving Private Ryan, and when they were showing houses, uh, people back in the States, they had the stars.
         You probably didn't recognize or even know what it meant.
      
      
         Oh.
         I haven't seen it yet.
      
      
         Oh.
         OK.
      
      
         
            
         
      
      
         Well, when you see it, when they show the stateside houses, you'll see the stars in the windows and that means that they have, how, how, many people they have in the service.
      
      
         Ooh.
      
      
         But, um, let's see.
         What else do you want to know?
      
      
         Hmm
         
         
      
      
         Did you know about me winning the piano competition?
      
      
         No!
      
      
         When I was, we sold the house, uh, on Fort Bragg Road and moved over to Circle Dr. And your grandmother was, she had a, had a, heart condition.
         I'm sure it was a congenital something or other because she always had to, to rest in the afternoon.
         She was never very, very healthy.
      
      
         I knew she died when you were young.
      
      
         Yeah, And, um, when I was 12, in October, when I was 12, she had a, stroke, or actually a blood clot and it went to her brain.
         It partially paralyzed her right side.
         And I was practicing the piano, doing all that sort of thing, and my teacher entered me into the competition for Classical Music for 16 and under.
      
      
         Wow!
      
      
         For the whole, for the state of NC.
      
      
         What an honor!
      
      
         And the competition was down in Wilmington and it was on the 17th of March, The Ides of March, and so, uh, she drove me down there, and, at that point Mother had had a stroke and was back in the hospital.
         So I went down and I played.
         And I won.
      
      
         Wow.
      
      
         I was 12 years old and I won 16 and under for the whole state of NC, Classical Competition.
      
      
         What'd you play?
      
      
         Ooh,
         I can't even remember.
         I've got in this vault something or other.
         I can still play it.
         But it was fairly complicated.
         And I was, nervous and all that sort of thing, but anyway I won.
         And we got back to Fayetteville and, I went, the, the teacher took me to the hospital and I went up to see, and Daddy was there, he'd gotten off work and was there, and mother had slipped, she was sort of in and out of a coma and I told him I had won.
         And he went in and told her, and she regained consciousness enough to say, "I am so proud!"
      
      
         Oh my God!
      
      
         And, she died two days later.
      
      
         What a great thing that, you know, she came back long enough to--
      
      
         Yeah, exactly.
      
      
         --to know that.
      
      
         Exactly.
      
      
         Wow!
         That's powerful!
      
      
         And I was, I was really proud of that!
         I still have the little cup.
         I think on of the handles is broken off of it.
         But I still have it!
      
      
         
            
         
      
      
         But I was pretty proud of that!
         And then
         I discovered boys and I didn't want to play the piano as much any more!
         
      
      
         Because Daddy had delusions that I would even go to Juilliard or Eastman School of Music.
      
      
         But hormones just kind of--
      
      
         Hormones kind of interfered, yeah.
         I wasn't dedicated enough to practice four, five or six hours every night.
      
      
         Right.
      
      
         But I had a good time with my piano!
         I played for all of the, the groups in the Glee Club and the Choral Group in all the little ensembles on school.
      
      
         Yeah?
         
         What kind of clubs were you in?
      
      
         Um, let's see
         .
         I was in the Tri-High Y, which is, I have, no idea, they probably don't even exist anymore, the High Y was for boys and the Tri-High Y was for girls.
         And I was in the National Honor Society, and I was in, the Glee Club and everything that went along with that.
         Um, when I took Spanish, I was in the Spanish Club.
         I was on the, um, the staff of the school newspaper; wrote a column for them.
         And, let's see, what else was I
         oh, I was in the Methodist Youth Fellowship in church, the MYF.
         And that's about it.
      
      
         So you were pretty busy!
      
      
         Yeah, I was.
         And I was, when I graduated from high school, I was Valedictorian and I also won the um, what the heck did they call it?
         The business, I think it was a business award, no, commercial award for being number one in the shorthand and typing classes.
         And I got that gold bracelet that I have, I was awarded for that.
         But back to, back to my birth mother, Julius, everybody called her Judy except for Daddy, he called her Julius.
      
      
         
            
         
      
      
         But she died in, in, gosh, 1951?
         Yeah, I was 12 years old, and, she died, then I was 13 May after she died.
         And that summer, her best friend was Leola Harvey.
      
      
         Uh-huh.
      
      
         And so that summer Leola's sister, Lucille, whose husband had died three years before, came down from Richmond to visit for her annual summer visit.
         She came down and stayed usually a couple of months, all summer.
         And she and Leola, Leola brought her over to see Daddy for a condolence call, and sparks flew and they started going out and that's when they decided to get married and she became my stepmom.
      
      
         Wow.
      
      
         And they got married in October after my mother died in March.
         Which at that point was highly, highly incensing!
      
      
         Right.
      
      
         I mean, you just, you had to mourn for a year.
         And I mean it was scandalous!
         So she had a lot of talk going on about her when she married Daddy and came down to Fayetteville.
         And, um, cried a lot about it because some people were very spiteful to her.
      
      
         It's hard to imagine grandmother being seen as a tart!
      
      
         Yea, yeah!
      
      
         
            
         
      
      
         But I mean, and, you know, she had the best intentions and I really needed a mother.
         I was 12, 13 years old, and I needed a woman, and there was even talk of putting me in a foster home or in an orphanage because it was scandalous that I was a young girl living alone with my father!
      
      
         Uh-huh.
      
      
         Which, I mean, in 1951, yeah.
         But today there's nothing wrong with it.
         So Daddy was I think, he loved her a lot, but she also answered a lot of his prayers for how to take care of me and deal with me.
         Because I had just started my period, and I was, you know, having acne and he didn't know how to deal with all that stuff!
      
      
         
            
         
      
      
         So he needed a woman to take care of me.
         And she was very glamorous and wore gorgeous clothes and dressed beautifully!
         And she taught me a lot and did a lot for me.
      
      
         Wow.
      
      
         And because my birth mother Judy was 5'2", and weighed about 145.
         So she was short and chubby.
         Sweetheart!
         A wonderful woman but it had, she and Leola had a lot of fun together and, but she was not classy.
      
      
         Right.
      
      
         She was a little country girl.
         Born and raised down in Cumberland County.
         Never lived anywhere else.
         And here was Lucille from the big city of Richmond--
         --Who wore high heels and stocking with the black seams up the back, and hats and had jewelry to go with every outfit and all that sort of thing.
         So, I mean, she just really swept daddy off his feet!
         And he was just absolutely, astounded by her because she was so incredible.
         And she entertained for him and, taught me a lot.
         She was just a great, great lady!
         And had always wanted a daughter, so there I was.
         And when they got married I was her only attendant and, her son, Alvin, was daddy's best man.
      
      
         That's sweet!
      
      
         Yeah.
         And Uncle Harmon gave her away.
      
      
         Hmm.
         I didn't know that.
      
      
         Yeah.
         So, what else?
      
      
         I think that's all.
      
      
         OK.
         Then turn off the tape.
      
      
         OK.
         Thanks for talking with me.
      
      
         You're welcome!
         My pleasure!
      
   

   
   
      
         Test, test I grew up in a very small town called Dacusville and that's in SC and here's the history behind Dacusville.
         It's a very small town that didn't or doesn't have a post office, doesn't have a grocery store, really only has a school and two gas stations.
         But we actually lived in the city of Easley and went to Pickens High School, but had also a different phone number.
         But anyway, there's some background of the type of small town that I grew up in.
         Um, my house was a house that sat on 15 acres of land, and I had, um, my mom and my dad and a three year old, older sister.
         Well at some point my dad decided that, uh, we needed to have goats, so we fenced in our front part of our yard, which was probably about six acres, and we got goats, and on, we also had other animals.
         Like we had a pony and we even actually had a ram at some point but that's another story.
         So we had these goats and they were in a fence, an electric fence, and we would have to cut the hay and bail the hay.
         Well I know I could not have been any older like six or seven years old when we had this pick-up truck that was a straight drive, and, or that's what we called in straight drive and that was a manual shift car or truck.
         And, um, I was really small and that's why I must have only been like six or seven because I couldn't do anything else.
         Um, I couldn't, um, help like bail the hay, pick up the hay, do anything because I was so small, so my mom and my dad and my older sister could, um, help collect the hay so my job became driving the truck and I could reach the pedals.
         I was tall enough to reach the pedals but my dad taught me how and I would get in that truck and drive around from point to point while they picked up the hay and put it in the truck and I'd drive the truck around and wherever it needed to go and they'd store the hay.
         So yeah, I learned how to drive at a very early age and needless to say my first car was a straight drive and no one, um, in that town really waited until they were 15 or 16 to drive.
         We all were driving pretty early because who's going to know about that far out that we didn't have a license so here's related, um, to driving.
         Another thing, uh, that I learned to, how to do very early on was drive a tractor.
         Of course because we had to have a tractor to cut the hay and do all the things that, you know, involved, I guess, in a semi quasi farm we were pretending to have.
         So my dad taught me how to drive this tractor and I thought I was big stuff because you sat up high on the tractor and you could see everything, and, you know, I could just drive it, and drive it, and drive it.
         Well, one Sunday afternoon it was early, no it was after church, um, before dinner was ready.
         I was out there and my dad said I could drive the tractor while we were waiting on dinner.
         So I was driving the tractor around, around, and around, and then I got called in for dinner, so I parked the tractor.
         Oh, our house also sat on a hill and, I think it sat on the top of a hill, and then the field and the fencing went down, and then across the street was my uncle's land and no one lived there.
         Over there it was another field that was fenced in and I don't think there were any animals over there, but it was a fenced in filed as well.
         So I parked this tractor at the top of our driveway, and I go in to eat dinner.
         So we eat and, I don't know, it probably takes about an hour, and I go back out.
         I want to ride the tractor.
         We go back outside for some reason and it wasn't there.
         And I don't have a clue as to what happened to it and I yell for my dad and we go out there and we start looking and we see trail marks all the way down the driveway through our field and then there is the tractor on the other side of the road in the fence.
         So guess what happened, I being the smart little, what, six year old that I was, decided that I forgot or didn't remember correctly that I had put the tractor in park and or in gear and not in neutral.
         I thought for sure, for sure I remembered that my dad said to put it in neutral.
         Yeah, well I remembered wrong so, uh, went over and got the tractor out and my dad drove it back, and I don't know what he did to the fence I'm sure that he fixed it I don't remember how badly it was damaged, but I was so upset I really thought I was big stuff.
         I mean I knew how to drive this tractor and I couldn't believe that I remembered wrong and I made that mistake and I first was scared because I thought I was in trouble but then when I realized I wasn't in trouble I was really, you know, I had lost a lot of confidence because I really thought I was big stuff.
         So I was like, "No more tractor.
         I don't want to have anything more to do with the tractor."
         Well my dad said, "Get back on it your going driving."
         So he made me get back on it because he wanted to teach me that we make mistakes and that you just have to get back on kind a like if you fall off a horse so that's my stories that I remember about driving.
         OK going back to the whole goat thing, I'll tell you another story about the goats.
         Uh the fence, um, we had this goat that we bottle fed, actually we bought, our dad bought the goat.
         Most of our goats were just regular farm goats, but this particular goat was registered.
         He was, you know, high class for a goat.
         He had papers and everything and we named him Remington.
         We named all are animals after TV characters.
         Like all are dogs all the goats were named after TV characters, so Remington was after, uh, I guess that show Remington I forget now but some character.
         Well he was our pet goat and we raised him.
         As a baby, we bottle fed him and we had to burn off his horns because if they grow up with horns then they can be dangerous, so you burn them off when they're little.
         We did that and we played with him basically like he was a dog because he was our little baby.
         He grew up, um, to be a very, um, close animal to us, but because we played with him so much he really thought that he was part of the family and he belonged really wherever we were.
         We'd let him in the house and, you know, take him in the car, take him in the truck, or just do whatever.
         So one day we were, uh, where, we were somewhere in the house, and, like I said, we had this electric fence and the electric fence works only so long until the goats figure out how to get out a of it or decide that they want out, so they'll, you know, endure the few seconds of shock.
         So yeah, Remington got out he didn't think he belonged in the fence anyway with the other goats so he'd gotten out and, uh, we look outside our house and we had a carport and, um, the storm door was open and the screen, and we look out and yeah he's on to a, the car, him standing on top of the car.
         That was when, I think, we decided we needed to set some more boundaries.
         So Remington, um, quickly had to learn some lessons.
         OK I'll tell ya another story about my dad because my dad grew up in basically the same area we did, um real country, and he was the youngest of 11 kids.
         Yeah, um, I'm sure he was an accident, um, and you can tell by his name.
         He kind of got the last of the pick, Homer Stobo.
         Yeah, well, um, well, was like I said, the youngest, so his parents by the time they had him were quite older and I don't think they paid him too much attention or maybe as his older siblings had to, um, have most of the part in his raising or upbringing that I think he was kind a left to do his own thing for quite a while.
         So he was quite rambunctious, so he used to always tell us stories about things he did as a kid.
         First of all, even though he was capable of, uh, going to school and doing his schoolwork, he chose not to and he would always, um, what you call play hooky, and on those days when we wouldn't go to school he would always come up with some kind of tricks, and one of the things I remember him saying that he did and actually since the time this time I had other people confirm that, uh, this is true that he would take a pocketbook, one of his mom's pocketbooks, and empty it out and tie it a string to the handle and he'd put it in the middle of the road and he and his buddy would let the string be long enough to where they could hide in the bushes and still have the string attached and then they'd wait for a car to drive by and there would always be a car to come by because, of course, this was in the country.
         And a car comes by and sees see a pocketbook they think, you know, we're going to pick this up and do one of two things.
         Their going to either take it, which what's more likely is that they're going to look because everybody knows everybody so they pick it up, or they get out of their car and they go to pick it up.
         Of course, as soon as they pick it up my dad and his friend just would jerk that pocketbook.
         Well you would think they'll just jerk it away and laugh.
         Well they decided that that wasn't fun enough so they would jerk it a little bit and make it seem like it was the wind, or just do it a little bit where they weren't, maybe the person wasn't quite sure if it really moved or not, or that maybe they accidentally kicked it and they'd do that a couple a times and then they would have basically be teasing the person along until the person just had thought they were going crazy.
         And then, uh, they finally realized what was going on and my dad and his friend would run and they would just run and run and run.
         And he would do all kinds of little tricks when he was out a school but, um, as it turns out he, um, he was quite into trouble his grades didn't quite make it.
         He made a D in PE, a D in, um, gym.
         Yeah he, he wasn't quite fond of school and he dropped out in May of his senior year, so although he later in life became successful and owned his own company, he just didn't, and I guess, and neither did his parents think school was that important so his, his stories they always told us didn't involve growing up and going to school and doing well and behaving they were always mischievous.
      
   

   
   
      
         I'm being interviewed by Umar Rashid.
         I was born in NY, but my ethnicity is Egyptian male, and I'm a student going to college, and Umar wanted me to talk about stories of culture and childhood.
         Well, my dad has told me about stories about when he came, when he came, just to go, back and see Egypt for after coming back for so many years and even be before he left Egypt about the quote unquote "hicks."
         They're not necessarily hicks they're just people who really didn't know any better.
         A lot of farmers, a lot of people who never experienced electricity, um, went to school and so they never knew things like the earth rotated.
         My, uh, dad was telling me a story about when he rode on the train this one time, and he was sitting next to this guy who was all giddy and all excited, and, um, he was telling my dad, "Do you think we're moving?"
         And my dad said, "Of course, yeah."
         And the guy replied, "Well no we're not moving, see?
         The earth rotates and we're just staying still.
         So that as the earth is rotating and we're staying still, we're moving from one point to the other."
         And that was one of the examples he told of how much education was important when he tried to explain things to me.
         Things like that.
         It was not that it was his fault.
         It was just that he didn't know any better and that was how people were like in Egypt, those poor people.
         And in Egypt there was no real middle class.
         You were either extremely poor or you were extremely wealthy.
         There was very little so-called middle class people.
         Then, of course, as time went on, he started talking to me about dating.
         And, of course, you know, dating was a cool thing if you were smart about it.
         When he was in Egypt early on in this time the people's of the, uh, the parents of the, their parents were really strict on, you know, should, well, boys and girls date.
         And the answer to a lot of those people was not a chance in hell.
         If you wanted to date a girl you would have had to take them outside the city because a lot of their parents, their fathers, or even their brothers, may either kill you or beat you up or force you to marry her.
         Of course neither was a, uh, option.
         He just wanted to, you know, enjoy a good time with a woman, not necessarily, you know, anything intimate but have a good conversation with a woman, and that was heavily frowned upon in the Middle East.
         Another thing that happened would be told me about, um, was in Egypt, you know, stories of women cheating on their husbands.
         In the culture of Egypt, if you were a Muslim when a, uh, if you were a woman and a girlfriend were to come over, the man would even leave the room or even leave the house because if there wasn't a man accompanying her, of course the man could not converse with her because of, you know, the temptation of whatever.
         And when this, when a woman would come over, it may or may not be a woman because this person has left the room.
         The, uh, my dad would tell me stories of people he knew who would, uh, dress up in women's clothing, with the full, you know, coverings and walk in and uh have sex with these men's wives and walk out.
      
      
         Do you remember anything specifically Joe?
      
      
         Well he wouldn't give me any specific names because, obviously I wouldn't know who these people were, but, uh, he would tell me stories like that.
         He also told me stories about how men and women went to the movies.
      
      
         Uh-huh.
      
      
         They would go into separate doors.
         The men would drop off the women in there from their cars, they would go and park and they would eventually walk together, and, of course, the women would walk behind the man.
         Now when they were to go pick up, you know, at the end of the night, the, uh, women would stand in the corner and the man would go get the cars.
         And the men really pretty much had no idea who their wives were because they were covered up.
      
      
         
            
         
      
      
         Basically whoever opened the door, that was their wife
         and that's when they drove off.
         And uh, it was kind of rather interesting.
         The differences in a culture in the Middle East.
         Of course, women you know would have to walk behind the man.
         In the Muslim world not necessarily in the cultural world, not necessarily a cultural, not necessarily Christian --
      
      
         I'm sorry Joe.
         How old were you when you started hearing these stories?
      
      
         Uh I don't know.
         I think it was about, well the whole dating thing was around 13, 14 so --
      
      
         Do you remember any from when you were around six or seven?
      
      
         Six or seven?
         Well that was the hick thing.
      
      
         Oh OK, OK.
         Sorry.
         
      
      
         Yeah I'm sorry Umar was not paying, he had left the room so I could continue telling the story just so you guys don't know.
         Now he came back so he's a little out of touch.
         Um, now we're going to go onto education.
         And, of course, my dad was, was very strict on education and education was very important for anybody in the Middle East, and of course nowadays anybody in the United States.
         You had to know your education.
         You had to go to school.
         My dad told me a lot of times when he was a TA in college he had to proctor an exam.
         And a--
      
      
         Sorry Joe.
         How old were you when you heard this?
      
      
         Tst, tst, tst.
         Well 11.
         Yeah.
         And, um, he told me the story of this woman he would not let take this exam because he didn't know if the person taking that exam was that women.
         You know, I mean because she would, it was very unusual that she would cover up more than was usual.
         And he wasn't sure if that was the person taking the exam.
         And so there was a whole commotion about it.
         The, uh, professor had to come in and the professor had to get a female to come in have her take a look at her and check her ID because in Egypt women didn't have ID's.
         You couldn't just, you know, here's an idea of a woman with a face covering, you know.
         That didn't really work in Egypt.
         And uh, of course education was very important.
         He told me stories of the educational system in Egypt.
         How very different it was in Egypt as opposed to here.
         One test determines whether what college you got to what profession you go into.
         There are two exams that you will take in your life in your junior year of high school and then in your senior year.
         The junior year is pretty much a practice exam and it's not based upon how well you do.
         It's based upon how well you do overall, everybody else.
         And what percentile you get determines what college you can get into because college in Egypt is free.
         So, uh, last time I heard, if you made a 94 or higher on a 100 point, this 100 point exam, you can go into an engineering school.
         But you couldn't go anything higher than that, not doctorate.
         You had to make a 97 to go into a doctorate school.
         Now, of course, you can go below that if you want another profession, but that's why education was very important in Egypt.
         Because what you know you had to do.
         In Egypt everyone competed against each other for the better grade, so everyone studied on their own, and, um, and definitely had different study practices and mental practices towards education in the Middle East.
         You know, stuff the teacher was well respected in the Middle East as opposed to here.
         You know, in the high school, where they can pretty much considered the baby sitter.
         This was no joke.
         You could be asked to leave in Egypt if you were told to.
         And those are the stories about education, women cheating dating, and the quote-unquote hicks.
         Thank you.
         Have a good day.
